## Request 6: Warrant Register Inspection (Education Code 42643)

*Note: This is a SEPARATE legal basis from CPRA. Education Code 42643 requires the county superintendent to maintain a warrant register "open to the inspection of the public." In SF, the SFUSD Superintendent serves as county superintendent. This request was sent as a separate email on 2026-02-08.*

Dear Records Officer,

In addition to my California Public Records Act request, I am separately requesting inspection of the county superintendent's register of warrants as required by California Education Code Section 42643.

Section 42643 requires that the superintendent of schools of each county "shall keep, open to the inspection of the public, a register of warrants, showing the fund upon which the requisitions have been drawn, the number, in whose favor, and for what purpose they were drawn."

As San Francisco is both a city-county and a unified school district, the SFUSD Superintendent serves as the county superintendent of schools and is the custodian of this register.

I am requesting inspection of — and copies of — the warrant register for the following fiscal years:

- FY 2020-21 (July 1, 2020 – June 30, 2021)
- FY 2021-22 (July 1, 2021 – June 30, 2022)
- FY 2022-23 (July 1, 2022 – June 30, 2023)
- FY 2023-24 (July 1, 2023 – June 30, 2024)

As required by statute, this register should include:
- The fund upon which each requisition was drawn
- The warrant number
- In whose favor (payee/vendor name)
- For what purpose the warrant was drawn

Please note that this is a standing statutory obligation under Education Code Section 42643, not solely a CPRA request. The register is required to be "open to the inspection of the public" at all times.

I note that SFUSD received a negative fiscal certification in May 2024 and is currently under fiscal oversight, which may affect any claim to alternative procedures under Education Code Section 42650.

I request copies in electronic format (PDF, Excel, or CSV). If in-person inspection is required before copies can be provided, please advise on scheduling.

## Legal Notes

### CPRA vs. Ed Code 42643 — Why Both?

| | CPRA (Requests 1-5) | Ed Code 42643 (Request 6) |
|---|---|---|
| **Legal basis** | Gov. Code 7920 et seq. | Education Code 42643 |
| **What it requests** | Copies of records | Inspection of a mandated register |
| **Response deadline** | 10 days | None — register must be "open" at all times |
| **Exemptions available** | Yes (deliberative process, etc.) | No — statute requires public access |
| **Enforcement** | Writ of mandamus | Writ of mandamus + potential state intervention |

### Key Statute Text

> **Ed Code 42643**: "The superintendent of schools of each county shall keep, open to the inspection of the public, a register of warrants, showing the fund upon which the requisitions have been drawn, the number, in whose favor, and for what purpose they were drawn."

### SFUSD's Negative Certification

SFUSD received a negative fiscal certification in May 2024 (meaning it may not meet its financial obligations for the current or two subsequent fiscal years). Under Ed Code 42650, "fiscally accountable" districts may use alternative warrant procedures — but SFUSD's negative certification arguably disqualifies it from this designation, strengthening the 42643 argument.

### SF's Unique City-County Structure

San Francisco is both a city-county and a unified school district. The SFUSD Superintendent simultaneously serves as the county superintendent of schools (SFCOE and SFUSD are the same entity). This means the warrant register obligation falls directly on SFUSD, not on a separate county office.
