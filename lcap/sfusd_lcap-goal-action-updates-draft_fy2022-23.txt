2022-23 Goal and Action Updates
Goal 1: Student Achievement
Create learning environments in all SFUSD schools that foster highly engaged and joyful learners and that support every student reaching her or his potential.
An explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal.
Goal 1 and the actions here focus on academic instruction, the resources students need for learning, monitoring student learning and the professional capacity building for staff to support students in meeting academic outcomes.


SFUSD is committed to helping all students develop strong academic knowledge and skills, as well as a host of dispositions and behaviors, that increase their curiosity and engagement, activate their full potential for learning, and prepare them for life, work, and study beyond their secondary school years.  Our goal is that every SFUSD student to possess the capacities in our graduate profile by the time they graduate high school: content knowledge, creativity, career & life skills, global, local & digital identity, leadership, empathy & collaboration, sense of purpose & sense of self.  


We hold that students learn in the powerful ways envisioned by Vision 2025 and our SFUSD core curriculum when they experience classrooms that are consistently high quality. The quality of teachers’ professional learning matters and our central office supports play a role in our ability to strengthen the instructional core.


While SFUSD has made gains in our graduation rates, including positive trends for targeted subgroups, there is a persistent achievement gap between subgroups.  Additionally, the 3-year trend for Kindergarten readiness and high school readiness measures has been mixed. Learning recovery will be a focus to address inequities exacerbated during the pandemic.  


All data used for baseline reporting is inclusive of District and County from 2018-19 (pre-pandemic year), unless indicated otherwise.  The baseline for attendance and expulsion data will be derived from the 2021-22 data.

Goal 1 Actions:
Original from 2021-24 LCAP
	Updated for 2022-23 Update
	1.01 Teaching & Learning: Instructional teams will continue to strengthen cross departmental collaboration and create coherent Pre-K - 12 continuum of instruction that is developmentally appropriate, culturally relevant, research and standards based and aligned to SFUSD’s graduate profile.This coherence will be accomplished by ensuring that the continuum of instruction includes an instructional literacy framework, aligned curricular resources, materials and assessments and professional development for both Tier 1 and Tier 2 instruction. The goals of the Literacy Framework are highlighted below. 


Within our Literacy Framework, we have the following Goals in alignment with our Response to Intervention 
1. Encompass Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and SFUSD’s Deeper Learning Framework
2. Provide explicit and systematic Foundational Skills Instruction to include phonics and word study, phonemic awareness and transference to reading and writing.
3. Differentiate reading instruction through small group instruction and guided reading to meet the needs of all students.
4. Provide students access to quality and culturally relevant text to access and read independently 
5. Address language structures and vocabulary development (How English Works, CA ELD Standards Part II) with explicit resources to foster simultaneous biliteracy development for multilingual students
6. Develop an approach towards assessment for learning - analysis of literacy learning to observe, adapt and respond to students individual strengths and needs to inform instruction


To ensure that educators have a deep understanding of the Literacy framework, practice and strong implementation, Professional Development for Tier 1 classroom instruction and Tier 2 intensive supports will be provided to school staff to meet the needs of the general education population and to accelerate the academic growth for children who require it toward  ensuring all SFUSD students graduate college and career ready.  Professional Development will be in the form of seminars, workshops and training, as well as coaching and collaboration/planning time. 


In addition to the assessment calendar that outlines the dates and local assessments that are mandated for the coming year there will be optional assessments listed. Teachers and site leaders will also be provided with an assessment matrix that provides guidance on various assessment tools for diagnostic, formative and assessments of and for learning to support and inform Tier 1 and 2 instruction.

   * Continue Black Family K-readiness Workshops:  3 Workshops facilitated by EED’s Family Support Specialist with content related to Math, Social Emotional and Wellness.
   * Continue PK-3rd grade Bayview Schools Professional Learning Community: 4 schools with teaching staff ranging from PK-2nd grades convened quarterly to learn and share best practices including: anti-racist teaching practices, language and literacy development,& Family Engagement geared towards African American students and families.  Next year will expand to 3rd grade.
* Latinx: 
   * Continue to increase Latinx students in the Dual Enrollment Program.
   * Increase participation in the Newcomers summer program.
   * DELAC/ELAC committees provide feedback and thought partnership on curricular programming and community support as needed.
* Native Hawaiian / Pacific Islander:  
   * Begin building the Native Hawaiian / Pacific Islander pathway in early education and support post-secondary readiness through dual enrollment, and extended learning opportunities for credit recovery, internships and STEM enrichment.  
   * Mentoring and tutoring services, which provide additional support to students beyond the school day.
* American Indian:
   * Continue to provide after school enrichment and academic support.
   * Increase community services to include wellness support, health services and wrap around supports. 
   * Continue to partner with the Indian Ed PAC to receive feedback on curricular programming. 




* We indicated Adopt / Adapt / Abandon
* Rationale: Partnering with the Indian Ed PAC has not been initiated yet, and insufficient funding makes this effort challenging. Efforts to recruit American Indian students to participate in after school and enrichment programs and boost the AI graduation rate have also stalled and need to be adapted. However, other components have been implemented and met with positive feedback from stakeholders and improved graduation and enrollment rates for our African-American and Latinx students. 










1.09 Teaching & Learning SpEd: In addition to the supports described above, our collaboration efforts with our instructional colleagues will focus professional development and technical assistance on Universal Design for Learning and a coherent literacy framework including tiered levels of support for students with disabilities. Our PD offerings for all educators will focus on inclusive practices and Tier 3 literacy supports and specially designed academic instruction in the least restrictive environments for special educators. We will continue behavioral support training for special education teachers serving students in our Success, Opportunity, Achievement, Resilience (SOAR) and Autism Focus programs. (e.g., Inclusive Practices, Ability Awareness, Social Emotional and Behavioral supports, Sensory Awareness, Literacy, Imagine Learning for ELs with IEPs, etc.) 




* We indicated Adopt / Adapt / Abandon
* Rationale: Developing a comprehensive team has already led to an uptake in using stakeholder input which will in turn be used to work towards realizing the Graduate Profile and Vision 2025. We will continue to strengthen our PD offerings for students on IEPs and expand  to include Math in the upcoming school year. We also anticipate an ongoing need for Safety Care and Behavior training and will continue to integrate and offer regularly. 










1.10 Teaching & Learning (SCG) EL/Newcomers: For English Language Learners, SFUSD will continue to ensure that students are properly identified and placed in effective language pathways and/or specialized programs and services. The district will provide teachers and site administrators professional development to consistently and effectively implement California English Language Development (ELD) standards in tandem with content standards, including both daily designated ELD as a stand alone class as well as integrated ELD during content instruction; invest in resources and professional development to provide focused support for Spanish-speaking ELs to build their home language assets and ensure equitable access to curriculum in order to increase English language proficiency/reclassification; employ designated English Language Development (ELD) instruction leveled by proficiency and Integrated ELD, and English Language Development Standards integrated during content instruction; and invest in resources to provide high quality and engaging summer programs for ELs. 




* We indicated Adopt / Adapt / Abandon
* Rationale: Our efforts here have already demonstrated higher academic outcomes for students, however staffing is an issue for expanding summer learning opportunities to reach all of our newcomer students. 
















1.11 Teaching & Learning (SCG) Foster Youth: In addition to the aforementioned supports, SFUSD will regularly monitor the progress of foster youth, and will ensure priority access for foster youth to tutoring and other academic and social/emotional supports, afterschool and summer enrichment programs, and extracurricular activities. SFUSD will continue work to connect every foster youth with a supportive adult at school.  


* We indicated Adopt / Adapt / Abandon 
* Rationale: Foster Youth need additional support and opportunities both at school and during school breaks. Data from Mentoring for Success has shown having a supportive adult at schools increases student attendance and in turn student outcomes. 
















1.12 (SFCOE) Standard Achievement - Maintain student to teacher ratios at or below 15:1 with increased specialist and co-teaching support. Continue to ensure that all students - even those in very small programs – have access to a full course of study for graduation and credit recovery. Adapt specific programming locations to meet emerging needs in the community, including shifts in response to changes in the juvenile justice system, youth immigration, and pandemic recovery.


* We indicated Adopt / Adapt / Abandon
* Rationale: Low teacher ratios with increased specialist and co-teaching support has been successful in re-engaging students in learning. Providing specific programming locations to meet emerging needs in the community continues to be necessary amid pandemic recovery. As other programs reduce in size and specialization, SFCOE schools are adapting towards increasing personalized learning to help students towards graduation and credit recovery. 








1.13 (SFCOE) Standard Achievement - Maintain and expand personalized learning and highly differentiated instruction and intervention across all programs for focal populations including English Learners, students with IEPs, foster, homeless, justice involved, detained, parenting youth. Build on capacities developed during emergency remote teaching to further personalize learning and school structures to accelerate learning.


* We indicated Adopt / Adapt / Abandon
* Rationale: We are continuing to see growth in teacher practice and student outcomes through personalizing learning and highly differentiated instruction intervention and will continue to focus on institutionalizing personalizing learning practices across school structures. 


















1.14 (SFCOE) Standard Achievement - Enhance and formalize the ILP system to increase specificity and ongoing monitoring. ILP' data reviews will include review of transcripts and of student profile data from Illuminate. Each will contain individualized graduation, skill building, and transition planning.


* We indicated Adopt / Adapt / Abandon
* Rationale: Formalizing the ILP system has already been fully implemented and has allowed for ongoing monitoring and data reporting at the individual, class, and school levels. Schools reported including student profile data was not useful and are adapting with other metrics based on this feedback. 




	



Goal 2: Access & Equity
Make social justice a reality by ensuring every student has access to high quality teaching and learning.
An explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal.
Goal 2 and the actions here focus on behavioral and social emotional supports to ensure supportive classroom environments, improve attendance and attend to the well-being of students and families, and provide additional supports to focal student groups.  


SFUSD holds a core belief that the achievement gap is the greatest civil rights issue facing our district. We believe that quality schools offer engaging and challenging programs, caring and committed staff, strong and visible leaders and instruction differentiated to meet each students’ needs. We hold an equity vision that calls on us to end bias and ensure equally high outcomes for our students, providing differentiated supports and services to attend to the whole child’s needs.


While SFUD has generally seen favorable responses in the Social-Emotional Learning Survey, particularly in Self-Management and Growth Mindset, the pandemic impacted students and families, particularly for focal student populations.  Stakeholder engagement over the last year and a half has also identified a need to build our capacity in anti-racist practices and authentic partnerships.  Chronic absenteeism was a district-wide focus prior to the pandemic and we will need to attend directly to student attendance as we anticipate a full return to in-person learning and address the needs of students who were identified as least engaged during distance learning.  


All data used for baseline reporting is inclusive of District and County from 2018-19 (pre-pandemic year), unless indicated otherwise.  The baseline for attendance and expulsion data will be derived from the 2021-22 data.

* Implement a new transportation vendor (Zum) with student centered technology at the core of their business.  Provide integrated communication for families, schools, and drivers.
* Strengthen the processes and procedures for allocating transportation services during IEP meetings, and explore student-centered, innovative, and sustainable transportation modes that expand offerings beyond curb-to-curb services and result in the least restrictive environment for our students.   
* Ensure general education routes are designed to provide focal students with equitable access to SFUSD’s elementary schools and programs.  Ensure stops are located in areas of the city with high concentrations of focal students and close to where they live e.g., near public housing.
* Partner with the San Francisco County Transportation Authority to create a School Access Plan with transportation solutions for K-5 students and their families. Proposed solutions will focus on children and caregivers who are burdened by medium and long-distance trips to school and afterschool activities.  Solutions will seek to close equity gaps and provide sustainable transportation options to help reduce vehicle travel.
* Bring the goals of Safe Routes to School to fruition.
* Strengthen the partnership between SFMuni and SFUSD, and increase opportunities for families to use SFMuni to get to and from school easily and efficiently.

2.11 Resource Management: Ensure access to healthy food and nutrition for all students PreK - 12.
* Encourage schools to remove some of the structural barriers to food access when we return to in person learning.  For example, if schools offer breakfast in the classroom, provide children with adequate time to eat lunch, and offer lunch after recess, then more children will participate in school meals and will have the nourishment needed to thrive in school and in life.
* Continue our efforts to eliminate the stigma of school food and encourage all students to enjoy school meals together as a community, taking full advantage of universal free school meals during the 2021-22 school year.  
* Expand breakfast in the classroom.
* Ensure students in distance learning have access to fresh, healthy, and delicious meals. 
* Implement a new point of sale system in all cafeterias to help reduce the amount of time students have to wait in line to receive school meals.
* Partner with School Health Programs to conduct deeper engagement with the community around our Wellness Policy as part of our triennial assessment of the Wellness Policy.
* Partner with Facilities to develop a 2022 Bond request to cover the cost of building a strong cooking infrastructure so we have the capacity to cook meals at schools instead of relying on the procurement of unitized meals.  
* Make procurement decisions in alignment with the Good Food Purchasing Policy, a process that transforms the way public institutions purchase food. 
* Continue redesigning school cafeterias into student centered dining spaces that delight students.
* Reengage our students in the development of student centered, delicious meals.
* Develop menus that are healthy, culturally diverse, affordable, fair, sustainable and loved by students.

Transition Specialist currently supports intake and orientation, transition planning, inter-agency coordination, and follow up. Work with Juvenile Probation and the Juvenile Court to increase services for youth who come before the court without being placed in county schools or shelters. Expand and adapt in response to radical changes in the juvenile justice system which result in serving fewer youth in detention but more severely justice involved youth in the community. Continue SFCOE role in juvenile justice reform and restructuring.

* We indicated Adopt / Adapt / Abandon
* Rationale: A Coordinated Care Team program would provide needed support to schools, but requires funding and infrastructure. Unless a centralized accountability system can be built into the system, it will not be possible to “ensure” that each school has a CCT. 
























2.02 Safe & Supportive Schools: Articulate and implement target strategies to address needs of underserved students, including focal student populations through a multi-tiered system of academic and behavioral supports across and within schools additional interventions and supports. 
* Provide additional resources for synchronous and asynchronous professional development opportunities to school staff and coordinated care team members to provide tiered level of support, including universal supports as part of creating a safe and supportive school culture and climate and enhanced supports for students that need support beyond the universal supports. 
* Support and expand site-based Wellness Centers at middle and high schools


* We indicated Adopt / Adapt / Abandon
* Rationale: The Supporting Students & Families Experiencing Homelessness (SAFEH) program has been successful in meeting the ever growing need of our students using a multi-tiered system of academic and mental health supports across the district and within school sites. However, the Safe and Supportive School program is unfunded and because a new BOE resolution requires a Coordinated Care approach, the recommendation is to focus limited resources there (see Action 2.01). Given upcoming shifts with 2021-22 budget cuts, other components need to be adapted or abandoned. 






























2.03 Resource Management: Identify resources to develop and sustain systems to better track and monitor attendance, suspensions, discipline, out of class time and interventions to understand implementation and impact.  Provide training resources to staff to develop their capacity to  utilize these systems to inform interventions.


* We indicated Adopt / Adapt / Abandon
* Rationale: Based on Division staffing reductions, future training materials and program support should shift to primarily focus on asynchronous methods of support such as manuals and training videos.
















2.04 Resource Management: Build on current expanded access to technology, with approximately 60% of SFUSD students gaining device access since Spring of 2020, and continue to explore options that would allow for device access for 100% of students and internet connectivity based on need in SFUSD. 


* We indicated Adopt / Adapt / Abandon
* Rationale: In order to apply for federal funding through the Emergency Connectivity Fund, we need to establish a record of unmet need. However, the district response rate on a survey meant to identify students who need devices had a response rate of 62%. The Emergency Connectivity Fund allows for secondary students to self-certify. The Department of Technology is exploring posting the survey questions into StudentVUE in order to increase the response rate amongst Middle and High School students.












2.05 Safe & Supportive Schools (SCG) ethnic focal student populations: In addition to the supports aforementioned, provide targeted supports to help all students and provide comprehensive wraparound services.
* Support specialty programming for African American students to provide post-secondary support and college preparation.  Continue efforts to focus improvements and provide additional resources for our identified PITCH schools.
* Work to coordinate support with City agencies to connect Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander students and families to health and wellness services.
* Work to coordinate with City agencies to connect American Indian students to health and wellness services. 




* We indicated Adopt / Adapt / Abandon
* Rationale: Supporting specialty programming for African American students has been met with positive feedback by the students being served. However, efforts to connect NHPI students and families and AI students to health wellness services need to be adapted to the current goals of the district around wellness centers in middle schools. 










2.06 Safe & Supportive Schools (SpEd): In addition to the supports aforementioned, students with additional needs as outlined in their IEPs receive targeted, appropriate supplemental support using the RtI2 framework and Universal Design for Learning.
* We indicated Adopt / Adapt / Abandon
* Rationale: In SFUSD all students on IEP’s are considered Gen. Education students first and are afforded academic and social/emotional opportunities in the Gen. Ed. setting to the greatest extent possible in alignment w/ their Least Restrictive Environment.  Students on IEP’s should receive accommodations, modifications, scaffolding and support in alignment with their Gen. Ed. peers.
















2.07 Safe & Supportive Schools (SCG) EL/Newcomer: In addition to the supports aforementioned, provide professional development focused on social emotional and cultural awareness for staff working with ELs and help Newcomer ELs transition into our school system by providing services and/or referrals for support and counseling through site based Wellness Centers.
* Conduct outreach, intakes, and care plans for eligible students, which includes referrals to Student & Family Services  through Refugee and Immigrant Supports in Education (RISE-SF) and work closely with community partners to provide school-based services for this population. Provide resources to  Liaisons across 23 different school sites offering ongoing student meetings or groups and school-wide events to promote positive school climate around refugee and immigrant issues.   
* Provide supports to counselors and ensure that newcomer and ELs receive the SEL and academic counseling needed to succeed throughout their PK-12 experience.


* We indicated Adopt / Adapt / Abandon
* Rationale: These services are essential for connecting our Refugee and Immigrant communities to the services/resources offered by SFUSD and our community partners to support a smooth transition and increased academic achievement. However, there is not a dedicated funding source for providing a school social worker, school district nurse, and one or more Family Liaisons for coordinating services for newcomer youth and families. This component needs to be adapted or abandoned based on updates to the MTSS and Weighted Student Formula and central supports in general. 


















2.08 Safe & Supportive Schools (SCG) Homeless & Foster Youth: In addition to the supports aforementioned, continue to support the infrastructure necessary to support and monitor the educational success of Foster Youth: 
* SFSD Focal Populations works across departments and divisions to highlight the need for synthesis of programs to provide individual support to students and families struggling with homelessness by connecting them to city resources for housing  and other immediate support. 
* Coordinate with EPC and school CCT Leads to implement interventions in support of our students and families struggling with homelessness.
* Work with CDE, county child welfare, and probation agencies, and SFUSD/COE Foster Youth Coordinating Program (FYSCP) to obtain, share, and analyze data to accurately identify foster youth and track progress on all required metrics.Use additional data to look at the intersectionality of student homelessness and focal indicators that are then used for support planning. Administer CDE’s annual homelessness questionnaire (AB27) to identify students and families experiencing homelessness in our district. SAFEH Enrollment form is used to collect information about any identified family's housing status and immediate support needs. 
* Provide information to families on the supports that exist through the city regarding eviction assistance, relocation assistance, rapid rehousing eligibility, and other long term housing supports
* Develop truancy policies that take account of the unique needs of and legal requirements for Foster Youth. 
* Ensure Foster Youth liaisons  and district level oversight staff have adequate time, knowledge, trauma-informed training, and resources to meet the needs of Foster Youth. 
* Collaborate with schools, child welfare and probation agencies, school sites and FYSCP district staff to increase school stability, promptly  transfer records, and increase attendance.
* Collaborate with HSA to provide transportation passes  to support school stability and access to School of Origin.


* We indicated Adopt / Adapt / Abandon
* Rationale: Establishing policies and procedures of foster youth rights is imperative and providing technical assistance to schools, families, and providers is essential to upholding those rights. The SAFEH program provides the resources and services that our students need to ensure academic success, and we will continue to coordinate across the district and with community and city partners to meet the needs of our students and families experiencing homelessness. Working with the CDE and partner agencies to ensure foster youth are identified and tracked on all required metrics is required for COE’s funding requirements, and collaborating across schools and child welfare and probation agencies is required by law. However, will need to reconsider developing truancy policies and how to provide training to district staff based on budget reductions.  










2.09 Resource Management: Manage design and construction of new school facilities, expansion or creation of new programs, and improve District’s school sites, creating an environment that will stimulate interest in learning and assist students and teachers to perform at their best. Respond to school requests for facilities improvements and deferred maintenance projects that ensure access to comfortable and welcoming learning environments, including projects that are required for seismic safety, fire safety, life safety, and Americans with Disabilities Act accessibility. Ensure access to clean facilities, sustainable programming and maintenance of schoolyards, and fiscally-responsible utility use to maximize investment in students’ instructional time.  Manage the design of school facilities and enhancements to school sites in service of health and safety; measures include window repair, ventilation system improvements, and other necessary site changes.


* We indicated Adopt / Adapt / Abandon
* Rationale: These projects are mandated by the BOE and need to be adopted, however, funding has continued to decline for annual deferred maintenance. Changes to staffing schedules already have resulted in better coverage of school sites. Climate change related wildfires are likely to persist for another decade, and SFUSD must adopt more effective ventilation strategies into its building program.












2.10 Resource Management: Strengthen transportation’s role in providing equitable access to the range of opportunities available to our students and ensure access to transportation as required.
* Implement a new transportation vendor (Zum) with student centered technology at the core of their business.  Provide integrated communication for families, schools, and drivers.
* Strengthen the processes and procedures for allocating transportation services during IEP meetings, and explore student-centered, innovative, and sustainable transportation modes that expand offerings beyond curb-to-curb services and result in the least restrictive environment for our students.   
* Ensure general education routes are designed to provide focal students with equitable access to SFUSD’s elementary schools and programs.  Ensure stops are located in areas of the city with high concentrations of focal students and close to where they live e.g., near public housing.
* Partner with the San Francisco County Transportation Authority to create a School Access Plan with transportation solutions for K-5 students and their families. Proposed solutions will focus on children and caregivers who are burdened by medium and long-distance trips to school and afterschool activities.  Solutions will seek to close equity gaps and provide sustainable transportation options to help reduce vehicle travel.
* Bring the goals of Safe Routes to School to fruition.
* Strengthen the partnership between SFMuni and SFUSD, and increase opportunities for families to use SFMuni to get to and from school easily and efficiently. 




* We indicated Adopt / Adapt / Abandon
* Rationale:  Every component is either required by board policy, is a required project charter with SFCTA or required by the SFTMA-SFUSD Safe Routes to School contract, or required for continued support of students with transportation in their IEP. Strengthening the partnership between SFMuni and SFUSD is also essential for continued equitable access for SFUSD students and families. 








2.11 Resource Management: Ensure access to healthy food and nutrition for all students PreK - 12.
* Encourage schools to remove some of the structural barriers to food access when we return to in person learning.  For example, if schools offer breakfast in the classroom, provide children with adequate time to eat lunch, and offer lunch after recess, then more children will participate in school meals and will have the nourishment needed to thrive in school and in life.
* Continue our efforts to eliminate the stigma of school food and encourage all students to enjoy school meals together as a community, taking full advantage of universal free school meals during the 2021-22 school year.  
* Expand breakfast in the classroom.
* Ensure students in distance learning have access to fresh, healthy, and delicious meals. 
* Implement a new point of sale system in all cafeterias to help reduce the amount of time students have to wait in line to receive school meals.
* Partner with School Health Programs to conduct deeper engagement with the community around our Wellness Policy as part of our triennial assessment of the Wellness Policy.
* Partner with Facilities to develop a 2022 Bond request to cover the cost of building a strong cooking infrastructure so we have the capacity to cook meals at schools instead of relying on the procurement of unitized meals.  
* Make procurement decisions in alignment with the Good Food Purchasing Policy, a process that transforms the way public institutions purchase food. 
* Continue redesigning school cafeterias into student centered dining spaces that delight students.
* Reengage our students in the development of student centered, delicious meals.
* Develop menus that are healthy, culturally diverse, affordable, fair, sustainable and loved by students.




* We indicated Adopt / Adapt / Abandon
* Rationale: Ensuring access to healthy food and nutrition and developing menus that are healthy, culturally diverse, affordable, and more must be done in compliance with USDA regulations at a minimum. Neither SNS nor site administrators have the bandwidth to continue efforts to eliminate the stigma of school food nor is there enough staff to partner with School Health Programs to work on our Wellness policy.  We will resume this work next year along with other activities. This year, we will continue to ensure students in distance learning have access to meals and continue implementation of a point of sale system in all cafeterias as well as embark on a Field Research Project that will provide additional information regarding the uptake of universal free school meals. 






2.12 (SFCOE) Access & Equity - Maintain increased staffing ratio of counselors, school psychologists, and school nurses at sites serving the majority of expelled and foster youth. Staff provide counseling, academic and social emotional development support and case management to COE students. Increase percentage of time Transition Specialist and Counselor pushed into classrooms in Court Schools. Restructure support team at Civic Center to push counseling into each classroom.




* We indicated Adopt / Adapt / Abandon
* Rationale: We continue to need an increased staffing ratio of counselors, school psychologists and school nurses as well as counseling, academic, and social emotional development support for COE students. We have been able to successfully transition some wraparound supports into roles of existing staff while partnering for highly specialized supports with outside partners, however, in response to pandemic-related changes in need, we will shift transition services to include support for youth in the expulsion process. 




2.13 (SFCOE) Access & Equity - Childcare: Maintain comprehensive, licensed on-site childcare to pregnant and parenting teens through partnership with local agencies serving youth from birth to kindergarten.


* We indicated Adopt / Adapt / Abandon
* Rationale: The need for childcare services has remained unchanged. 






















2.14 (SFCOE) Access & Equity - Transition Support: Continue role of Transition Specialist who supports youth as they transition between court schools and other placements, youth returning from expulsion, and youth placed in neglected shelters. Transition Specialist currently supports intake and orientation, transition planning, inter-agency coordination, and follow up. Work with Juvenile Probation and the Juvenile Court to increase services for youth who come before the court without being placed in county schools or shelters. Expand and adapt in response to radical changes in the juvenile justice system which result in serving fewer youth in detention but more severely justice involved youth in the community. Continue SFCOE role in juvenile justice reform and restructuring.


* We indicated Adopt / Adapt / Abandon
* Rationale: We will continue these services and expand to support youth in the expulsion process and due to recent legislation, expand to include high school graduate Transition Aged Youth returned from DJJ through SB 823 Realignment. 














2.15 Access & Equity - Implement Board Policy 5101.2 Elementary School Student Assignment, which is designed to create integrated elementary schools, offer families a high degree of predictability about where their children will be enrolled in school, and facilitate enrollment within a reasonable geographic distance from home. Develop zones for elementary school student assignments in partnership with families and community members.


* We indicated Adopt / Adapt / Abandon
* Rationale: We will continue building partnerships and supports with staff, families, and other stakeholders and integrating more perspectives into the work of developing draft zones, from other departments and from external partners (e.g. DCYF, SFMTA)
	________________
Goal 3: Accountability
Keep district promises to students and families and enlist everyone in the community to join in doing so.
An explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal.
Goal 3 and the actions here focus on providing access and support to families in ways that are linguistically and culturally responsive, ensure our classrooms are staffed with high quality educators to meet the needs of students and provide for stable infrastructure needed to support critical district functions.


SFUSD recognizes that families are the first and most influential teachers of their children. Respecting and welcoming all families into the school community supports the academic achievement of all students.  


While families in SFUSD have a highly favorable view of the CultureClimate of their children’s schools with a 93% positive average for each of the last 3 years, we see differentiated results for some of our focal student populations.


Stakeholder engagement over the last year and a half highlighted more than ever the importance of partnerships  between home and schools, and the need for communication that is multi-directional and inclusive of all stakeholders. 


We must recruit and retain diverse talent reflective of our school communities and support staff in building their capacity to deliver on our promise to provide quality education for all our students.  We continue to improve our processes for planning investments, allocating resources and monitoring for implementation and impact.  


All data used for baseline reporting is from 2018-19 (pre-pandemic year).

Goal 3 Actions:


Original from 2021-24 LCAP
	Updated for 2022-23 Update
	3.01 Family Empowerment: Schools actively engage families in leadership opportunities that allow them to voice concerns and priorities, as well as participate in site planning in a meaningful way. Schools reach out to hear from families and solicit feedback to better support focal students. Communication processes are two-way, clear to families and encourage a mutual exchange of information. Essential information is provided in multiple languages and interpretation is provided at school meetings and events. Provide interpretation for school site and district events in Samoan, Spanish, Cantonese, Mandarin, Arabic, Tagalog, Vietnamese and other languages as needed, and prioritize the timely translation of SFUSD essential documents and documents from schools that meet the 15% threshold language requirement.

3.02 Family Empowerment: Strengthen the structures for shared responsibility across different departments in the district to lead practices that inform, engage, and empower SFUSD students and families, including: 
* Build the capacity of district staff through culturally competent professional development to engage all students and families, and especially our focal students and their families in effective and authentic partnerships that link family engagement as well as student voice to student learning and support positive school cultures.
* Conduct district wide Family Wellness Check ins at least twice a year as a family partnership strategy to engage in authentic partnership with families. The district wide Family Wellness Check-ins are a moment in time where collectively as a district we reach out to students and families.
* Provide professional learning resources and technical assistance for district staff, students and families in order to make informed decisions, including support to school governance bodies and parent advisory groups (i.e. SSC, ELAC, AAPAC, SAC) 
* Provide professional development and training on the Best Practices Tool Kits for district wide school events, including Back to School, Parent Teacher Conferences, and the School Site Planning process. 
* Provide resources, materials and support to families through the enrollment process to ensure families have equitable access to participate in the school choice process.

* Enlist parents, educators and community partners in monitoring and improving systems and strategies to support African American students and focus on how to effectively engage, affirm, and empower African American students and families.
* Provide meaningful parent/guardian communication, outreach and engagement to monitor English learners and assign appropriate staffing and provide professional development for personnel working with English learners.
* Increase knowledge and understanding of SFUSD staff about the reclassification process and timeline in order to improve information sharing with families.
* Fulfill all requests for interpretation or translation of materials for IEP-related communications in a timely manner.

* Explore, identify and scale effective strategies to improve on the recruitment, retention, and engagement of our current and future employees.
* Diagnose human capital related issues using qualitative and quantitative methods and develop data informed solutions and practices across both certificated and classified staff.
* Develop and implement strategies to strengthen the recruitment and retention of teachers and administrators at hard-to-staff schools and build a workforce that reflects our diverse communities.
* Continue to build out and learn from our internal pipeline programs, including the Pathway to Teaching, Para-to-Teacher program, and our residency programs and the District’s partnerships with University programs  which yield diverse and high quality staff.

* We indicated Adopt / Adapt / Abandon
* Rationale: Providing information and interpretation services in multiple languages is essential for family engagement and are state and federal requirements. However, constraints in funding and staffing capacity limit our student leadership work, and there is no accountability system in place to ensure this work happens nor to ensure clear and mutual communication processes with families. 














3.02 Family Empowerment: Strengthen the structures for shared responsibility across different departments in the district to lead practices that inform, engage, and empower SFUSD students and families, including: 
* Build the capacity of district staff through culturally competent professional development to engage all students and families, and especially our focal students and their families in effective and authentic partnerships that link family engagement as well as student voice to student learning and support positive school cultures.
* Conduct district wide Family Wellness Check ins at least twice a year as a family partnership strategy to engage in authentic partnership with families. The district wide Family Wellness Check-ins are a moment in time where collectively as a district we reach out to students and families.
* Provide professional learning resources and technical assistance for district staff, students and families in order to make informed decisions, including support to school governance bodies and parent advisory groups (i.e. SSC, ELAC, AAPAC, SAC) 
* Provide professional development and training on the Best Practices Tool Kits for district wide school events, including Back to School, Parent Teacher Conferences, and the School Site Planning process. 
* Provide resources, materials and support to families through the enrollment process to ensure families have equitable access to participate in the school choice process.


* We indicated Adopt / Adapt / Abandon
* Rationale: 


















3.03 Family Empowerment: Develop the systems to communicate clear expectations, measures, and districtwide accountability, including building capacity to communicate with families through email and/or text message and improve collection of family contact information in the Student Information System (SIS).


* We indicated Adopt / Adapt / Abandon
* Rationale: Family communication is essential for student success, and as of January 2022, 90% of students have at least one parent/guardian with a ParentVUE account. 
















3.04 Family Empowerment (SCG): Provide additional targeted supports for focal student subgroups by investing in additional staff supports (such as Family Liaisons), additional professional development for staff, increased materials and food for family events focused on serving families of students in underserved communities, additional translation supports and software


* We indicated Adopt / Adapt / Abandon
* Rationale: We continue to learn from these supports and study if they increase family/community engagement and ultimately student success. Additionally, we have adapted to virtual for family events. 


















3.05 Family Empowerment (SCG): Support parent advisory bodies through staffing and resources to provide outreach and engagement opportunities for focal student populations including African American, American Indian/Alaskan Native, Latinx, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, families of students with IEPs, Foster and Homeless Youth and our English Learner and Newcomer families.


* Enlist parents, educators and community partners in monitoring and improving systems and strategies to support African American students and focus on how to effectively engage, affirm, and empower African American students and families.
* Provide meaningful parent/guardian communication, outreach and engagement to monitor English learners and assign appropriate staffing and provide professional development for personnel working with English learners.
* Increase knowledge and understanding of SFUSD staff about the reclassification process and timeline in order to improve information sharing with families.
* Fulfill all requests for interpretation or translation of materials for IEP-related communications in a timely manner.


* We indicated Adopt / Adapt / Abandon
* Rationale: Parent advisory groups provide opportunity for communication and engagement, and we will continue these processes which allow  for multiple opportunities and modalities of engagement, advertising the reclassification process to school sites leaders and teachers in addition to families, and providing translation requests for second language families as requested. 












3.06 Talent & Culture: Recruit and retain diverse talent reflective of our school community and support our staff in building their capacity to deliver on our promise to provide a quality education for each and every student. Key actions include: 
* Explore, identify and scale effective strategies to improve on the recruitment, retention, and engagement of our current and future employees.
* Diagnose human capital related issues using qualitative and quantitative methods and develop data informed solutions and practices across both certificated and classified staff.
* Develop and implement strategies to strengthen the recruitment and retention of teachers and administrators at hard-to-staff schools and build a workforce that reflects our diverse communities.
* Continue to build out and learn from our internal pipeline programs, including the Pathway to Teaching, Para-to-Teacher program, and our residency programs and the District’s partnerships with University programs  which yield diverse and high quality staff.




* We indicated Adopt / Adapt / Abandon
* Rationale: These are key strategies for retaining and recruiting high quality and diverse teachers and administrators.
















3.07 Resource Management: Develop critical tools & systems, build a resilient infrastructure, and redefine the classroom experience to transform SFUSD into a digital district in an effort to realize Vision 2025 and implement the SFUSD strategic plan so that every student in every school is future ready for college and career success in the 21st century.
* Critical tools & systems: Examples include: Empower SF (SFUSD’s HR, Payroll, and Budget Management enterprise system), Learning Management Systems (LMSs), Student Information System, including online applications, and student and family portals, email, collaboration, and communication systems and tools
* Build a resilient infrastructure: Examples include: Internet and network modernization for more robust and secure access to the Internet, telephony system modernization at schools and central offices, disaster recovery and system continuity, cybersecurity
* Redefine the classroom experience: Examples include Technology-Enabled Personalized Learning Environments, Deeper Learning programs, Digital Learning Scope and Sequence implementation, iLab Impact and Innovation awards, and other innovation pilots.


* We indicated Adopt / Adapt / Abandon
* Rationale: Projects to redefine the classroom experience will allow the entire SFUSD community to build essential skills and help students develop the Graduate Profile competencies. It is essential to continue work to enhance interoperability between systems that support teaching and learning workflow in order to provide a coherent user experience, aligned support, and access to needed systems and applications. We are in the first phase of a multi-year project to develop a resilient infrastructure that among improvements would help ensure cyber security. 






3.08 Resource Management: Support core operations (e.g. maintain stable financial operations, core HR and business systems, manage and prevent risk and liability)




* We indicated Adopt / Adapt / Abandon
* Rationale: We need to continue to strategically prioritize and manage resources to maintain fiscal stability and invest in core operations and high impact strategies. 














3.09 (SFCOE) Accountability - Accreditation: All SFCOE schools will progress from initial accreditation to full accreditation.


* We indicated Adopt / Adapt / Abandon
* Rationale: All SFCOE schools have continued in the accreditation process, however, pandemic-related delays to site visits mean we need a few more months before all sites will move from the initial to the full accreditation phase.
















3.10 (SFCOE) Family Empowerment:
* All families entering county community and opportunity programs will receive a personalized orientation to the school, including advising, resources, and introductions to key staff.
* All County schools will implement their customized family engagement plan including how to effectively orient families, how to keep them informed about their students’ progress, and involve them in the life of the school.


* We indicated Adopt / Adapt / Abandon
* Rationale: Individual orientations receive positive feedback from most families and help create the culture of the school, and we continue to customize and test strategies and new tools for remote and synchronous communication.












3.11 (SFCOE) Accountability - n/a


* We indicated Adopt / Adapt / Abandon
* Rationale: These systems have already been integrated or completed.
