CERTIFICATED / TEACHERS
WHY SFUSD?
The word ‘teacher’ is defined as a person who teaches or instructs, especially as a profession. However, in SFUSD, we believe this profession is so much more. Our teachers are tasked with working with a diverse group of students, ensuring they are ready for college, career and life. They have the responsibility of committing themselves to social justice and making sure to account for equity and student achievement in their daily work. While certificated positions also include various roles based outside of the classroom, we view anyone within this distinction as an educator of our future generation.
Certificated positions include Teachers, School Nurses, Instructional Coaches, Teacher Librarians and other positions that require a credential (e.g. School Counselors, School Psychologists, School Social Workers, Speech Language Pathologists etc.). We encourage anyone committed to our
Mission and Vision
, along with our
Core Values
, to submit their application with us. All applications are reviewed carefully and we will contact you if your skills and experience are a match for one of our openings.
