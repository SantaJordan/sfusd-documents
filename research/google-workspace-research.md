# SFUSD Google Workspace & Gemini AI Spending Research
## February 2026

---

## Executive Summary

SFUSD uses Google Workspace for Education, purchased through CDW Government — the #1 Google Workspace for Education reseller in North America (7 of 10 school districts buying paid Google Workspace use CDW). CDW Government received **$1,715,566.81** from SFUSD in the vendor payment period, though this likely includes hardware and other products beyond Google Workspace licensing.

As of February 3, 2026, Google began rolling out **Gemini AI capabilities** to all Education Plus customers — meaning SFUSD students and staff now have access to generative AI tools bundled into their existing Workspace licenses.

### Key Licensing Change (2025-2026)

---

## SFUSD Cost Estimates

### Education Plus Base License

SFUSD has approximately **49,000 students** and **10,000+ staff**. Under the new licensing model:

| Scenario | Users | Price/User/Year | Annual Cost |
|----------|-------|-----------------|-------------|
| All users on Education Plus | ~59,000 | $6 | ~$354,000/year |
| Students only (old model) | ~49,000 | $6 | ~$294,000/year |

### Gemini AI (Google AI Pro for Education)

If SFUSD were to add Google AI Pro for Education:

| Scenario | Users | Price/User/Year | Annual Cost |
|----------|-------|-----------------|-------------|
| All staff | ~10,000 | $360 | ~$3,600,000/year |
| Same scale as OpenAI contract (12,000) | 12,000 | $360 | ~$4,320,000/year |
| All users | ~59,000 | $360 | ~$21,240,000/year |

## CDW Government — SFUSD Vendor Payments

From the SFUSD vendor payment summary (BoardDocs):

| Vendor | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| **CDW Government** | **$1,715,566.81** |

**Important context:**
- CDW Government sells more than Google Workspace — they also provide Chromebooks, networking equipment, peripherals, and other software
- CDW is the largest Google Workspace for Education reseller (serves 5,000+ institutions, 12 of 15 largest US school districts)
- The $1.7M figure cannot be fully attributed to Google Workspace without itemized purchase orders
- The Google Workspace portion is likely a fraction of the total CDW spend

### Isolating Google Workspace Costs

Without itemized purchase orders (which SFUSD does not publish), we cannot determine the exact Google Workspace spend. However:

- At $6/user/year for ~59,000 users = ~$354,000 for Education Plus base
- CDW reseller markup is typically 5-15%
- Estimated Google Workspace cost through CDW: **$370,000–$410,000/year**
- Remaining ~$1.3M in CDW payments likely covers hardware (Chromebooks, etc.)

---

## The "$324/License" Claim

The OpenAI contract research references SFUSD paying "$324/license for Gemini." This figure does not match standard Google pricing:

- Education Plus: $6/user/year
- Google AI Pro for Education: $360/user/year ($30/month)

The **$324 figure** may represent:
1. A negotiated CDW discount on Google AI Pro ($360 × 0.90 = $324)
2. A reference to a bundle price (Education Plus + some Gemini features)
3. An internal SFUSD budget line item for a specific subset of users

**Status: Unverified.** The $324 figure requires a CPRA request to confirm.

## Comparison: AI Spending vs. Teacher Pay

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| PERB cost of 1% raise for all employees | $10.17M/year |
| OpenAI contract (est. at San Bernardino rate) | ~$2.7M/year |
| Google AI Pro for 12,000 users | ~$4.3M/year |
| Google Workspace base (Education Plus) | ~$354,000/year |
| CDW Government total payments | $1,715,566.81 |
| Combined AI tools (OpenAI + Google AI Pro, 12K users) | ~$7.0M/year |
| Gap between PERB recommendation (3%+3%) and district offer (2%+2%+2%) | ~$10.17M/year |

## Board Approval Records

No specific board approval for the Google Workspace contract was found in BoardDocs searches. Google Workspace renewals typically flow through:
1. CDW Government as reseller
2. Technology department procurement
3. Consent calendar ratification (if above threshold)

The CDW Government payment of $1.7M suggests this is handled as a routine technology procurement, not a separately board-approved contract.
