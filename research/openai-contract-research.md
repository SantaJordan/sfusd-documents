# SFUSD-OpenAI Contract Research
## Primary Source Analysis — February 2026

---

## Executive Summary

In January 2026, SFUSD quietly signed a contract with OpenAI for ChatGPT EDU deployment to 12,000 users. The deal was signed by a technology officer before board approval, placed on a consent calendar to avoid public debate, had its pricing redacted, and was pulled from the agenda after board members raised concerns — all during a historic teacher strike where AI in classrooms was a central bargaining issue.

**OpenAI does NOT appear in SFUSD's vendor payment records.** No payment has been made. The contract was signed but pulled before board ratification.

## San Bernardino CUSD-OpenAI Contract (Unredacted Comparison)

This is the baseline contract that reveals what SFUSD's redacted pricing likely looks like:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Product** | ChatGPT EDU |
| **Number of End Users** | 500 |
| **Monthly Price** | $19 per End User |
| **Term** | 12 months |
| **Total Fees** | $114,000.00 |
| **Start Date** | November 12, 2024 |
| **Billing** | Annual upfront on Effective Date |
| **Payment Terms** | Net 30 |
| **Payment Method** | ACH |
| **Billing Contact** | APInvoices@sbcusd.k12.ca.us |
| **Primary Contact** | Michelle.Cleveland@sbcusd.k12.ca.us |

### Implied SFUSD Cost Estimate
If SFUSD's rate matched San Bernardino's $19/user/month:
- 12,000 users x $19/month x 12 months = **$2,736,000/year**

However, the district claims the deal is "cost-free." CSU system reportedly paid ~$30/user for 500,000 users ($15M total). Volume discounts or an external funder may explain the discrepancy.

## Key Findings

### 1. Contract Signed Before Board Approval
Eddie H. Ngo signed the contract on 1/22/2026 — the effective start date was 2/2/2026. The board wasn't scheduled to vote until 2/10/2026, meaning services could have been active for 8 days before any oversight.

### 2. Pricing Deliberately Hidden
The redaction of pricing is unusual for public contracts. Superintendent Su had obtained special redaction authority just 5 days before (1/27/2026). This authority is normally used for personal privacy (names, addresses), not contract pricing.

### 3. "Cost-Free" Claim Is Unverified
The district claims no financial cost, but:
- San Bernardino paid $19/user/month ($228/user/year)
- At SFUSD scale (12,000 users), this would be ~$2.7M/year
- No grant acceptance was on the board agenda
- If truly free, it should be listed as a "gift" not on the consent calendar
- SFUSD already pays Google $324/license for Gemini

### 4. Contact Email Raises Questions
The primary contact listed is `znd_g0@hotmail.com` — a personal Hotmail address, not an official @sfusd.edu address. This is unusual for a district-wide technology procurement.

### 5. Union Was Not Consulted
The teachers' union (UESF) had demanded AI regulation in the 2023-24 contract talks. The district rejected that language. Signing the OpenAI contract during strike negotiations — without union consultation — inflamed an already volatile situation.

### 6. Student Privacy Framework is Borrowed
SFUSD didn't negotiate its own data privacy terms. It subscribed to San Bernardino's DPA via "Exhibit E" (General Offer of Privacy Terms), accepting a boilerplate framework written for a different, smaller district.

## Warrant / Check Register Status

**No SFUSD warrant or check register entries for OpenAI were found.** This is consistent with the contract being pulled before board ratification — no payment was authorized or made.

### What We Searched
- **SFUSD BoardDocs**: Exhaustive search of all SFUSD PDFs on BoardDocs. Unlike other California school districts (Palo Alto USD, Newark USD, Glendale USD), SFUSD does **not** publish itemized warrant registers or check registers on BoardDocs.
- **SFUSD Vendor Payment Summary**: 15-page PDF with 687 vendors — OpenAI is absent. Source: https://go.boarddocs.com/ca/sfusd/Board.nsf/files/DHKSRD73E74A/$file/VendorName-Amount.pdf
- **DataSF Open Data Portal**: The City & County of SF Controller's Office publishes vendor payments at https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Vendor-Payments-Vouchers-/n9pm-xkyq — however, SFUSD is a legally separate entity and may not appear in city payment data.
- **SF OpenBook**: City financial transparency portal at https://openbook.sfgov.org — same limitation as DataSF (covers city departments, not SFUSD independently).
- **SFUSD Financial Reports on BoardDocs**:
  - 1st Interim Report FY 2025-26: https://go.boarddocs.com/ca/sfusd/Board.nsf/files/DP2V8U7F8998/$file/2026-12-09%201st%20Interim%20Report%20Presentation.pdf
  - 2nd Interim Report FY 2024-25: https://go.boarddocs.com/ca/sfusd/Board.nsf/files/DEK5DY0FCF5E/$file/SFUSD%202nd%20Interim%20Financial%20Report.pdf
  - Recommended Budget FY 2025-26: https://go.boarddocs.com/ca/sfusd/Board.nsf/files/DHM3Y40916B6/$file/2025-06-17%202025-26%20Recommended%20Budget%201st%20Reading%20(1).pdf
- **SFUSD Ratification of Contracts**: Board agenda items for contract ratification (e.g., J.14 on Nov 12, 2024) list only facilities contracts — no technology/software contracts were found referencing OpenAI.

### Why No Warrant Data Exists
SFUSD's contract with OpenAI was signed on 1/22/2026 but **pulled from the Feb 10 board agenda before ratification**. Under SFUSD policy (Education Code Section 17604; Board Policies 3311 & 3312), contracts entered by delegated authority must be ratified by the Board within 60 days. Since the board meeting was canceled due to the strike and the item was already removed, no payment was ever authorized, invoiced, or disbursed. There is no warrant to find because no money changed hands.

### Comparison: Other Districts DO Publish Warrants
For reference, these California school districts publish itemized warrant registers on BoardDocs:
- **Palo Alto USD**: https://go.boarddocs.com/ca/pausd/Board.nsf/files/DG9NJD602420/$file/20250513WarrantsDescendingOrderApril.pdf
- **Newark USD**: https://go.boarddocs.com/ca/nusd/Board.nsf/files/DEGU8S7ADC55/$file/Warrant%20Report%20February%202025.pdf
- **Glendale USD**: https://go.boarddocs.com/ca/gusd/Board.nsf/files/DK4THN777987/$file/Warrant%20Recap%20July%202025.pdf

SFUSD does not follow this practice — they publish aggregate vendor payment summaries rather than individual check/warrant registers.
