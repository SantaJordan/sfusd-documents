Financial Updates
Jennifer Schuster provided updates on QTEA (Quality Teacher and Education Act) financials, highlighting the structure of revenue and expenditures:
• The initial parcel tax was set at $198 per parcel, increasing annually with the CPI-U for the San Francisco Bay Area. Revenue depends on parcel count, rate, and delinquency rate.
• The UESF (United Educators of San Francisco) portion, constituting 71.260% of revenue, funds salaries, retention bonuses, retirement support, PAR coaches, induction mentors, and Impact and Innovation Awards.
• The remaining portion supports equity adjustments, professional development, oversight, technology, and charter schools.
• Some carryover is expected, though final figures will be confirmed after the fiscal books are closed.
FWEA (Fair Wage and Equity Act)
An update was provided on the history of LWEA (Prop G) and its transition into FWEA. The design allocates 75% of funds to UESF and 25% to the District for salary increases and professional development. This includes other bargaining units such as Local 21 Tech and SEIU. Charter schools also benefit from these funds.
Committee members inquired about trends in spending and tracking. Staff confirmed such tracking exists.
