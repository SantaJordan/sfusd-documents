The citizens of San Franciso have approved two parcel taxes designed to support the San Francisco Unified School District: the Quality Teacher & Education Act, Prop A, June 2008 (QTEA) and the Living Wage for Educators Act, Prop G, June 2018 (LWEA).
QTEA stated that "an independent oversight committee shall be appointed by the Board of Education to ensure that the proceeds from this proposition are expended for the purposes described in the proposition."Simliarly, LWEA stated that "the oversight committee created pursuant to Proposition A on the June 2008 San Francisco ballot shall, starting with the Act's first operative year, submit a report on at least an annual basis to the Mayor, Board of Supervisors and Board of Education evaluating whether the proceeds form the Act are being properly expended for the purposes set forth in the Act."
This committee has 9 positions (2 appointed by the Superintendent, 1 appointed by each of our 7 Board of Education Commissioners).
