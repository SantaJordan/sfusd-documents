About PEEF
Link to this section
In 2004, San Francisco voters approved the ballot initiative Proposition H, establishing the Public Education Enrichment Fund (PEEF) as law within the City Charter, Section 16.123.1-10. The City of San Francisco contributes to this fund annually from its discretionary General Fund revenues to support education programs for San Francisco’s youth. One-third of the PEEF fund is allocated to the City of San Francisco’s Office of Early Care and Education for preschool support. The remaining two-thirds of the PEEF fund is assigned to the San Francisco Unified School District, which serves approximately 50,000 students across 136 schools.
San Franciscans renewed their commitment to children, youth, and families in 2014 by reauthorizing PEEF and passing Proposition C, the Children and Families First Initiative, with a 74% approval vote. The passage of Proposition C guaranteed to fund PEEF and the Children and Youth Fund (formerly known as the Children’s Fund) through the 2040-41 academic year.
The legislation mandates that half of the SFUSD allocation supports Sports, Libraries, the Arts, and Music (SLAM), and half supports Other General Uses (OGU) programs that promote general education purposes. The SFUSD superintendent prioritizes programs for OGU funding that support the District’s goals and strategic plan and provide academic, student, and family support. The District uses PEEF funds to shore up and expand existing resources and to pilot new programming. The superintendent prepares an annual PEEF expenditure proposal that outlines how the District will spend the PEEF allocation and submits it to the Board of Education Commissioners for approval.
PEEF resources enhance sports, libraries, arts, and music programs. For instance, because of PEEF, every SFUSD school has a library and credentialed librarian (PEEF funds 91% of the librarians). Additionally, every student has access to a nurse or social worker (nearly two-thirds of nurses and social workers who serve students in grades PEEF funds K-8).
