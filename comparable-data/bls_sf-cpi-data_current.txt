Consumer Price Index, San Francisco Area â December 2025
Area prices were up 3.0 percent over the year in December
The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward increased 3.0 percent  for the 12 months ending in December, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported today. Regional Commissioner Chris Rosenlund noted that the index for all items less food and energy rose 3.0 percent over the year. The food index increased 4.3 percent, while the energy index decreased 0.2 percent.
BLS did not collect survey data for October 2025 due to a lapse in appropriations. BLS is unable to retroactively collect these data. For a few indexes, BLS uses nonsurvey data sources instead of survey data to make the index calculations. BLS was able to retroactively acquire most of the nonsurvey data for October. Accordingly, all analysis in this release is over the year and not seasonally adjusted.

Note: The October 2025 data values are not available due to the 2025 lapse in appropriations.
Federal Government Shutdown
BLS did not collect survey data for October 2025 due to a lapse in appropriations. BLS was unable to retroactively collect these data. For a few indexes, BLS uses nonsurvey data sources instead of survey data to make the index calculations. BLS was able to retroactively acquire most of the nonsurvey data for October. CPI data collection resumed on November 14, 2025.
Additional information about the
impact of the shutdown on CPI data
is available online.
Changes to health insurance index
With the release of November 2025 data on December 18, 2025, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) removed long-term care (LTC) insurance from the health insurance index. There have been changes in the market for LTC insurance that now make it out of scope and ineligible for pricing in the CPI market basket.
The February 2026 Consumer Price Index for the San Francisco area is scheduled to be released on March 11, 2026.
Technical Note
The
Consumer Price Index
(CPI) is a measure of the average change in prices over time in a fixed market basket of goods and services. The Consumer Price Index for San Francisco is published bi-monthly. The set of components and sub-aggregates published for regional and metropolitan indexes is more limited than at the U.S. city average level; these indexes are byproducts of the national CPI program. Each local index has a much smaller sample size than the national or regional indexes and is, therefore, subject to substantially more sampling and other measurement error. As a result, local-area indexes are more volatile than the national or regional indexes. In addition, local indexes are not adjusted for seasonal influences.
NOTE: Area indexes do not measure differences in the level of prices between cities; they only measure the average change in prices for each area since the base period.
A full all-items data series history for the original index value and for 1-month, 2-month, 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month percent changes can be accessed via BLS data query tools. A direct link to the all-items series is provided in Table 1 of this release under historical data.
The San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, CA. metropolitan area covered in this release is comprised of Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo Counties in the State of California.
