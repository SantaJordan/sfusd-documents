Missing Data
Local educational agencies (LEAs) in California spend approximately a hundred billion dollars to provide a high-quality education for almost six million students. To record and account for these expenditures, the LEAs utilize the standardized account code structure (SACS) and prepare financial reports for adoption by the LEAs’ governing boards and review by oversight entities. LEAs use the
SACS Web Financial Reporting System (SACS Web System)
to prepare and review financial reports.
SACS Data Viewer Access
Once the LEAs’ reports are finalized in the SACS Web System, the reports are published to the SACS Data Viewer site where interested parties may obtain copies of the reports for fiscal year 2022–23 and after. Finalized reports are those reports that have been approved by the LEA’s governing board and reviewed by the oversight entity.
SACS Data Viewer Application
Users are encouraged to review the following information and available resources prior to using the SACS Data Viewer to facilitate understanding of information contained in the reports and effective use of the data provided. The resources are grouped as follows:
Overview of the Reporting Process
provides an overview of the preparation and approval of financial reports.
Using SACS Data Viewer Files
provides helpful tips for users accessing information from the SACS Data Viewer. Beginning with the Fiscal Year and Reporting Period section, detailed information is provided for users, by topic in order of appearance on the SACS Data Viewer page, to help navigate the website.
Fund Forms and Supplemental Forms
provide general information on various files available through SACS Data Viewer, followed by information specific to charter schools and possible missing data scenarios.
Overview of the Reporting Process
The process to report data in the California Department of Education (CDE) SACS Web System begins with the LEA recording its financial transactions in their local financial system. The LEA transfers the information from their financial system to the CDE SACS Web System and enters other information manually. The LEA reviews the data for accuracy and completeness according to the technical review specifications established by the CDE. Financial reports are submitted to the LEA’s governing board, and then to the LEA's reviewing/oversight agency.
Since budget development is an interactive and complex process, an LEA may have multiple draft dataset versions. However, only one is selected as a final version to be approved by the LEA’s governing board, submitted to the oversight entity for review and approval, and, eventually published in SACS Data Viewer.
California Education Code
(
EC
) prescribes specific oversight duties for the reviewing agencies, such as approval of budgets (or conditional approval, or disapproval) and concurrence with interim report certifications as either positive, qualified or negative. Therefore, the published budget datasets could be approved, conditionally approved or disapproved by the oversight entity; the published interim reports could be certified as positive, negative, or qualified.
The reviewing agency's process of resolving exceptions varies by agency, but the process generally involves an interactive dialogue between the LEA and the reviewing agency. The following entities perform review and oversight functions:
The CDE is the reviewing and oversight entity for the 58 county offices of education (COEs) and the seven school districts in single-district counties (Alpine, Amador, Del Norte, Mariposa, Plumas, San Francisco, and Sierra);
Each COE serves as the reviewing and oversight entity for all school districts and Joint Powers Agencies in the county, plus the charter schools authorized by the COE or authorized by the State Board of Education (SBE) with oversight authority delegated to the COE;
Each school district serves as the reviewing and oversight entity for charter schools authorized by the district, plus the charter schools authorized by the SBE with oversight authority delegated to the district; and
The SBE serves as the reviewing and oversight entity for charter schools authorized by the SBE.
The specific process and due dates for preparation and review of financial reports is outlined in the
Financial Reporting and Fiscal Oversight Calendars
.
Using SACS Data Viewer Files
Forms  and reports stored in SACS Data Viewer can assist interested parties in various  ways.
The forms that comprise the LEA’s dataset can provide information on the overall financial position of the LEA, including current and projected revenues, expenditures and fund balances. To facilitate review of the LEA’s financial position, a user may start with Fund 01, Form MYP, and criteria and standards review, and continue with other documents. This data is best viewed in the PDF format. Additionally, each LEA’s website may provide information on the activities and priorities that form the LEA’s budget.
Current year budget status information is available at the
Fiscal Status
web page to supplement the review of budget and interim reports available in SACS Data Viewer.
CDE’s publication of the
Annual Financial Data
will continue. SACS Data Viewer provides the same unaudited actual data in a different format. The two resources may be used together for research and analysis.
Data extract files provide fiscal data in a consistent format to allow research and analysis of data across LEAs, or across time periods. Data extract files are available for a specific LEA or as a consolidated file with data for multiple LEAs as explained in the
Consolidated Data
below.
Fiscal Year and Reporting Period
The fiscal year for California LEAs begins on July 1 and ends on June 30 of the next calendar year. For example, fiscal year 2023–24 refers to the time period of July 1, 2023, through June 30, 2024. California’s fiscal year is different than the federal fiscal year which begins on October 1 and ends on September 30 of the next calendar year.
LEAs report financial data for the same fiscal year (July 1 – June 30) at multiple points in time based on designated reporting periods, as shown in the table below; each subsequent period after the initial budget adoption reflects adjustments as revenues and expenditures change from estimated (budgeted) to actual during the fiscal year.

For the Budget, July 1 reporting period, the datasets will be published twice. First, all the available Budget, July 1 datasets are published in October. Then, any revised datasets will be published in December.
Under certain circumstances, some LEAs may be required to prepare an additional report, known as Third Interim or End of Year Projections, covering the reporting period from July 1 through April 30. These reports are not published in SACS Data Viewer. Any requests for Third Interim reports, if applicable to a particular LEA, should be referred to the individual LEA or the COE with jurisdiction over the LEA’s county.
Although the above calendar applies to all LEAs, some charter schools do not use SACS forms. Therefore, their budget or interim period reports are not available in SACS Data Viewer. Their UAs are available in SACS Data Viewer in a report known as Charter School Unaudited Actuals Financial Report—Alternative Form.
CDE publishes all available datasets based on the schedule listed above. Once publishing is completed, CDE notifies all LEA users in SACS Web System that datasets for an applicable reporting period have been published. If datasets for an LEA appear to be missing from SACS Data Viewer, see
Missing Data
below for some possible reasons.
Entity Type and Entity Name
The following public educational agencies use the SACS Web System for reporting financial information:
county offices of education, also known as COEs;
school districts;
joint powers agencies, also known as JPAs; and,
charter schools.
All  of the above are referred to as LEAs for purposes of SACS, SACS Web System, and  SACS Data Viewer. The
California School Directory
provides information on each  of the LEAs and its schools.
Entity Names are listed in alphabetical order. Users may type in all or a portion of the name in the Entity Name field to see matching records available.
In addition to financial data for individual LEAs, SACS Data Viewer provides consolidated files for each of the 58 counties, plus charter schools under the oversight of the State Board of Education, and all LEAs in the state. For detailed information, see
Consolidated Data
below.
Available Records
If  there is an eligible dataset in the SACS Web System at the time statewide data  are published for a specific fiscal year and reporting period, the SACS Data  Viewer will generate a table of multiple files under the heading Available  Records that contain LEA-specific data. Financial reports for a given LEA and a  given reporting period consist of multiple components, available in multiple  formats.
Form Name
LEA financial data are presented in a series of forms, comprised of
Fund Forms
and
Supplemental Forms
. Form Name column lists each form name, with exception of Data Extract (Excel File) and Single Export (Dat File) because these file formats contain data from multiple forms. Some forms are made of multiple files, thus, such form names appear multiple times in Form Name column in Available Records table.
File Name
All  file names contain the following:
CDS Code
– The 14-digit CDS code is the official, unique identification of a school within California. The first two digits identify the county, the next five digits identify the LEA, and the last seven digits identify the school. For additional information refer to the
County-District-School Administration
web page.
Reporting Period
– The reporting period refers to either budget, first interim, second interim or UA, as detailed in the
Fiscal Year and Reporting Period
section above.
Fiscal Year
– The fiscal year refers to the California fiscal year, which coincides with a school year.
Dataset Number
– The unique number identifies the entire financial dataset for a given reporting period. This number is used for all the files, fund forms and supplemental forms that make up the financial dataset.
Form
– The abbreviated name of a fund form or supplemental form. In most cases, the format of the forms differ between budget and UA reporting period and the interim reporting periods. The system adds an “I” at the end of the form abbreviation to indicate interim reporting period.
Additional details for
Fund Forms
and
Supplemental Forms
as shown in the sections below.

Fund Forms
Fund forms are used by the LEAs to record activities in the  various funds. A fund is a fiscal and accounting entity with a self-balancing  set of accounts recording financial resources and liabilities.
Every LEA has Fund 01, also known as general  fund (except certain charter schools reporting separately from authorizer using  Fund 62), plus a number of additional funds established pursuant to the
CSAM.
Fund forms provide information separately for  unrestricted and restricted funds, and in a combined format. Unrestricted funds  refer to money that is not subject to legal or donor limitations regarding its  use and can generally be used for any educational or operational purpose. Restricted  funds refer to money which use is controlled by law or donor or designated for  specific purposes by the LEA or its governing board.
For more information on fund accounting, see
CSAM
Procedure 105. For more information on fund classification, see
CSAM
Procedure 305 available on the
Definitions, Instructions, & Procedures
web page.
Budget and Unaudited Actual Fund Forms
Budget and unaudited  actuals fund forms provide three different displays:
Expenditures by  Object
—Displays summarized and detailed revenues, expenditures, and other  financing sources and uses by major object in the operating statements and  includes year end balances in the fund reconciliation. Object is a four-digit  code in the SACS account string used to classify revenues, expenditures, and  balance sheet accounts. For additional information, refer to
CSAM,
Procedure  330.
Expenditures by  Function
—Contains the same data as expenditures by object; however, the  expenditures section is displayed by major function rather than object and is  only summarized. Function is a four-digit code in the SACS account string used  to identify activities or services performed to support or accomplish one or  more goals or objectives. For additional information, refer to
CSAM,
Procedure  325.
Restricted Detail
—Displays detail  of restricted balances by resource.
Fund forms display  both budget data for the budget year (labeled “BB” in data files) and actual  data for the completed fiscal year (labeled “BE” or “BA”), as in the following  examples:
A 2023–24 Budget reporting period fund form will  provide 2022–23 estimated actual data and 2023–24 budget data.
A 2023–24 Unaudited Actuals reporting period fund  form will provide 2023–24 unaudited actual financial data and 2024–25 budget.
Interim Fund Forms
The interim fund  forms contain four different versions of financial data designed to track the  financial operations of the LEA over the course of the fiscal year, as follows:
Original Budget
(labeled “IO”) is  the current year budget adopted on or before July 1, or the revised budget of  an LEA whose original July 1 budget was disapproved by its oversight agency.
Board Approved Operating Budget
(labeled “IB”) is the latest approved operating budget. If the governing  board has not approved any amendments to the budget, the Board Approved  Operating Budget will be the same as the Original Budget.
Actuals to Date
(labeled “IA”) represents  the actual revenue received and expenditures paid as of the close of the  interim reporting period.
Projected Year Totals
(labeled “IP”) represents the total projected revenue, expenditures, and  other activities for the entire year. It includes all required year-end  accruals of revenues and expenditures.
Fund Forms List
Fund  accounting is a system used by government entities to track spending and  allocate taxpayer money for various programs, services, and projects. Fund  accounting allows governments to demonstrate fiscal responsibility and  compliance with legal mandates by separating funds based on their intended use.  California’s standardized account code structure provides the following fund  forms for LEA use:

Charter School Financial Reports
A  charter school is a public school that may provide instruction in any  combination of grades (transitional kindergarten through grade twelve).  Financial reporting by charter schools can be done in multiple ways, and the  charter school can change a reporting method from one fiscal year to the next.  Charter school unaudited  actuals financial data may be  reported either:
With the data from their authorizing agency (school district or COE) in the authorizing agency's General Fund [County School Service Fund] (Fund 01), Charter Schools Special Revenue Fund (Fund 09), or Charter Schools Enterprise Fund (Fund 62); or,
Separately from the authorizing agency, by using either the Charter School Unaudited Actuals Financial Report Alternative Form or the traditional SACS reporting forms. If using the traditional SACS forms, charters should use one of the following as their main operating fund: General Fund (Fund 01) or Charter Schools Enterprise Fund (Fund 62) which allows accrual accounting for not-for-profit charter schools. Charter schools using Fund 01 as their main operating fund may also report data in other funds, as appropriate.
To  determine the charter school authorizing agency refer to the five-digit code in  the CDS code of the charter school and locate the school district or the COE in  the
California School Directory
.
General  charter school resources are available on the CDE website as follows:
Charter schools
CalEdFacts
provides general information on charter schools in California.
The
Charter Schools
web page provides detailed information on charter schools.
Missing Data
LEA Missing  from Entity Name List
There are some instances where an LEA name is  not available in the Entity Name list.
Individual schools (non-charter) are not  listed in the Entity Name because LEAs do not report financial data in SACS at  the school level. California LEAs produce reports to fulfill federal  requirements that provide some information at the school level, such as the
Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) school-level per-pupil expenditures (PPE)
.
If the LEA is a charter school and the  charter school is not operational in the selected fiscal year, and the charter  school is not expected to submit financial data, the SACS Web system removes  the charter school from a list of LEAs eligible to file financial reports.  Information on closed charter schools is available in the
California School  Directory
and
Charter School Locator
.
Records Missing for an LEA
Possible Reasons for Missing Records
Users may encounter situations when SACS Data  Viewer does not produce a set of files for a specific LEA. This may occur due  to any of the following:
The  LEA is a charter school reporting data with its authorizer LEA (see
Charter School  Financial Reports
).
The  LEA is a charter school reporting separately for budget or interim period using  an alternative form that is not part of the SACS Web System.
The  LEA prepared financial reports using SACS Web System but the reports were not  promoted through the electronic routing to the applicable stage in time for publishing in SACS Data  Viewer.
The  LEA did not prepare financial reports using SACS Web System.
Common Administration Districts
These districts, paired  as elementary and high school districts, have the same administration, school  board, and teachers' organization. A common district files a joint financial  report but separate demographic and attendance reports. There are currently  five of these districts in California:
Arena  Union Elementary/Point Arena Joint Union High (Mendocino County);
Modesto  City Schools (Stanislaus County);
Petaluma  City Elementary/Joint Union High (Sonoma County);
Santa  Cruz City Elementary/High (Santa Cruz County); and,
Santa  Rosa Elementary-High (Sonoma County).
For example, a user  looking for Santa Rosa Elementary district will not find data under this  district name because Santa Rosa Elementary does not report financial data.  Instead, Santa Rosa City Schools reports financial data for both Santa Rosa  Elementary and Santa Rosa High school districts.
All Charter Districts
As of fiscal year 2022–23, there are seven all-charter  districts operating in California, which are defined as school districts in  which all schools have been converted to charter schools. Their financial data  is presented under the school district Entity Type rather than charter school.
Alvina Elementary school district with Alvina  Elementary Charter school (Fresno County);
Kingsburg Elementary Charter school district  with the following schools (Fresno County):
Ronald W. Reagan Elementary
Island Community Day
Lincoln Elementary
Roosevelt Elementary
Washington Elementary
Rafer Johnson Junior High
