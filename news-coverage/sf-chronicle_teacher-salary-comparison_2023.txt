How much do S.F. teachers really get paid? It's complicated

The question seems simple enough: How much do San Francisco teachers make compared with educators in other districts across the state?

The answer is at the center of ongoing contract negotiations between the district and the teachers union, with educators threatening to strike, given how far apart the two sides are on salaries.

But figuring out how much the 3,600 credentialed teachers make in total compensation and where San Francisco Unified stands compared with other public schools is anything but simple. Salary is only one part of the formula, while health benefits and pensions are also part of the package.

Then there's another piece, one rarely acknowledged, but costly: lifetime retiree health benefits for all staff, a rare offering among districts that is costing San Francisco Unified nearly $40 million a year, and increasing about $2 million annually.

Based on salary alone, the city's school district -- with a mid-career teacher paycheck of $89,000 a year -- ranked 74th out of the 268 California districts with at least 250 teachers, according to a Chronicle analysis of 2022 state Department of Education data on certificated salaries and benefits for unionized educators.

That's well below $147,000 in Mountain View Los Altos Union High School District at the top of the list and far above the $55,000 in Sacramento City Unified at the bottom.

When health benefits for current employees are added in, San Francisco's compensation reaches $98,000, and the district drops to 129th place.

Compensation for mid-career teachers in California (districts with at least 250 full-time teachers):

Top districts by total compensation:
1. Mountain View Los Altos Union High - $168K ($147K salary, $21K health)
2. Fremont Union High - $142K ($119K salary, $23K health)
3. Santa Clara Unified - $135K ($123K salary, $13K health)
4. San Mateo Union High - $133K ($114K salary, $19K health)
5. Sequoia Union High - $130K ($111K salary, $19K health)
6. Palo Alto Unified - $130K ($114K salary, $16K health)
7. East Side Union High - $126K ($102K salary, $24K health)
8. Garden Grove Unified - $125K ($103K salary, $22K health)
9. Tamalpais Union High - $123K ($102K salary, $21K health)
10. Huntington Beach Union High - $121K ($99K salary, $23K health)

(Note: San Francisco Unified ranked 129th at $98K total compensation)

That's not good enough, teachers say.

"We won't make as much as those super-wealthy Palo Alto districts," said Emily Patterson, a special education teacher. "But the district needs to understand we can't keep making what we're making and be able to survive on that."

The question is how much the district can afford.

San Francisco Unified isn't alone in its struggles to balance its budget, grappling with declining enrollment, eye-popping pension costs and increasing health insurance contributions as well as ever-rising special education obligations. It's on track to spend $25 million to $36 million more every year than it will get in revenue over the next few years.

Additional state revenue isn't keeping up with costs, and the state has appointed a fiscal expert to keep tabs on district spending.

This is the reality even though city property owners pony up $48 million annually through the Proposition J parcel tax to help cover the last teacher pay raise of 8%, as well as other support positions like counselors and social workers.

The union wants a $12,000 raise for every teacher in year one of a new contract, pushing them up to about 14th place -- and then a 7.5% increase in year two. The district has offered a 5% one-year raise.

It hasn't been easy for teachers in recent years. The impact of pandemic lingers, with emotional and academic fallout. In addition, a statewide teacher, aide and substitute shortage has increased the workload for educators, who have to cover vacant classrooms on their breaks or planning periods. And in San Francisco, where the cost of living is already a deterrent to new hires, a massive payroll fiasco has left teachers and other staff with error-riddled paychecks for nearly two years.

Administrators and teachers say if they want to lure more educators to the district, salaries have be more competitive.

"We need salary increases," said labor leader Cassondra Curiel, president of the United Educators of San Francisco.

Few dispute that, including the superintendent and school board members, who control the purse strings.

Often unspoken, however, is how much the district is spending on educator compensation now.

A deeper dive into state data shows San Francisco spends $343 million on salaries and health benefits for current credentialed teachers, or $7,000 for each of the district's nearly 49,000 students -- which is the 14th highest rate among the 268 districts.

Teacher compensation spending per student (top districts):
1. Mountain View Los Altos Union High - $10.6K ($48M total, 5K students)
2. Palo Alto Unified - $10.3K ($108M total, 10K students)
3. Sequoia Union High - $10.2K ($88M total, 9K students)
4. Santa Clara Unified - $9K ($127M total, 14K students)
5. Sunnyvale Elementary - $8.1K ($44M total, 5K students)
...
14. San Francisco Unified - $7K ($343M total, 49K students)

In other words, the district spends a lot on its teachers, but it's spread among more of them than most other districts, where the average ratio is 1 educator for every 20 students.

In San Francisco, it's 1 educator per 14 students.

If the teacher-to-student ratio was 1 to 20, the average salary and benefits package for unionized and credentialed educators in San Francisco would be closer to $140,000 at the current level of spending compared to $95,000 now.

The analysis doesn't include the 3,000 additional members of the teachers union who are not credentialed, including teacher aides.

Those numbers might surprise some teachers, parents and students who see much larger class sizes at their schools, but that varies across the district.

Why is San Francisco's teacher-student ratio the third lowest of the districts analyzed?

Like many school systems across the state, San Francisco has declining enrollment, losing more than 4,000 students in recent years with a projected loss of another 4,500 within the next decade. But the school board has failed to reduce school, administrative and other staff.

Educators and some school board members have criticized the district for a bloated central office, saying cuts there could help cover increases in teacher pay, but it's unclear how much could be cut.

Part of the central office budget, administrative costs reached $25 million this year, or 4% of the budget, with a larger part, or $143.7 million, going to transportation, food services, maintenance, security and facilities, and other needs.

And earlier this week, the teachers union released a scathing report alleging years of mismanagement and lost opportunities for boosting revenue, which they link to their low salaries.

Superintendent Matt Wayne told the Chronicle that it's critical for the district to address staffing levels based on enrollment, which includes eliminating positions as well as figuring out what to do with empty seats in classrooms. That could eventually mean closing or merging schools, but those options are a last resort to ensure the district is financially sound, he said.

"In the end, because we don't have unlimited resources, there are tradeoffs we have to make," Wayne told the Chronicle this week. Currently, the city's public schools are headed for a fiscal cliff, which complicates increasing teacher salaries.

The district has been overspending for years, using one-time funds to backfill the now $1.2 billion budget -- leading to bankruptcy if the school board doesn't cut costs.

So far, the district and unions have no intention of cutting those lifetime retiree health benefits.

Decades ago, the school board agreed to provide the benefit to retirees, giving employees an incentive to stay. But that was before U.S. health care spending skyrocketed, resulting in a 900% cost increase since 1970.

It has become a costly contract-based benefit for union and nonunion retirees with 20 years in the district, despite the availability of free federal Medicare health insurance for those 65 and over.

All told, the future liability to the district for the benefit is more than $700 million, a whopping sum and the highest amount for retiree health debt behind Los Angeles and Fresno. What it means, in terms of teacher salaries, is that educators have agreed to delay some of their compensation until they are done teaching, when it will cost the district up to $20,000 per year per person. But it's not money that helps pay rent now.

It's still a retention tool, Curiel said.

San Francisco district leaders, who are also eligible for the benefit, did not provide comment on the impact of retiree health costs on the budget or whether they plan to raise the issue in contract negotiations.

The often unmentioned trade-off of those retiree benefits is less money to spend on students now, said Paul Bruno, assistant professor of education at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, who has researched the issue in California.

"For a lot of districts, they are in a situation whether they acknowledge or not, they are making choices about whether to allocate resources to students in classrooms now and the teacher in them, or to defer compensation later to teachers in retirement," he said. "It's not benefiting kids who are in the classroom today."
