If San Francisco schools shutter for a teachers strike in the coming weeks, where will all the kids go?
That’s the 50,000-student question facing San Francisco Unified School District Superintendent Maria Su. The Board of Education voted Tuesday to grant her special powers to maintain spaces for students or, if necessary, close the district’s roughly 120 schools in the event of a strike.
In a press conference Tuesday evening, Su said it is unlikely the district could find capacity for anywhere close to the full student population. She said the district would prioritize the roughly 7,000 special education students and those living in homeless shelters.

Su estimated that after-school and other enrichment programs could take in between a few hundred and 1,000 students whose caregivers cannot miss work.
“We know there are a lot of families who cannot make work-schedule changes with just a few days’ notice, and that’s really hard,” Su said. “My No. 1 goal is to get our labor partners back to the table so that we can continue the conversation that we started.”
Every day that schools are closed, the district’s financial situation worsens, Su warned — SFUSD will lose as much as $7 million to $10 million daily, as it incurs state fines for ceasing instruction.
The United Educators of San Francisco and the district have been locked in negotiations since March, disagreeing over salary increases, healthcare benefits for dependents, and increasing staffing for special education. More than 5,000 educators in UESF — 97.6% of voters — said yes to a strike last week. The union is expected to decide within 10 days whether it will move forward with a work stoppage — the first among San Francisco teachers since 1979.
“The ball is in SFUSD’s court. The superintendent can avoid any disruptions to our students’ education and stabilize our district if the district comes to the table with serious proposals that prioritize our students,” UESF President Cassondra Curiel said in a statement.
The decision to strike will come following Wednesday’s release of a neutral fact-finding report from the Public Employment Relations Board; Su hopes the findings will prompt both sides back to the table Friday.

In the event of a strike, the district will have to rapidly find solutions for where to safely supervise tens of thousands of students.
Su will have options. The board is allowing her to cut through red tape, empowering her to enter into contracts and spend money on personnel without its approval and to “take all necessary steps” to keep schools open.
But after-school programs and childhood-serving nonprofits are scrambling to prepare.
Sherrice Dorsey-Smith, executive director of the city’s Department of Children, Youth, and Their Families, confirmed that the department is working to assess organizations’ ability to take in students during school days.
They will not have enough capacity, she cautioned.

“Even with these efforts, it is not possible to serve the full SFUSD student population,” she said, “because community-based spaces are limited.”
DCYF has been coordinating with community groups participating in school nutrition programs to support food distribution for students who will need access to hot meals during a strike.
The union is also seeking child-care support for families, with mixed success.
At a virtual town hall meeting last week, the UESF told parents it is working with organizations like the YMCA and after-school programs to get ready for an influx of students.
“We care deeply about our students, so this decision, and being forced to be in this place, has been really, really hard for us,” said Geri Almanza, an elementary teacher and UESF’s treasurer. “So it’s time to start thinking about plans.”
The union said it has “been in contact” with all programs under SFUSD’s

network of after-school sites, Almanza said. The list includes Wah Mei School at Alice Fong Yu, Mission Graduates at Sanchez Elementary, and the Boys & Girls Clubs, which serve several schools.
“They’re all assessing their capability of working with young people,” she told attendees of the meeting. “We have a series of other scheduled conversations with all the partners who are eager to ensure you’re able to go to work and your child has a safe space to be at.”
Some of the organizations and city departments highlighted by the union told The Standard they are ready to offer limited spaces for students, while others, including the San Francisco Public Library and the Recreation and Parks Department, said they had no plans to do so.
Curt Yagi, executive director of Real Options for City Kids, said his organization has enough capacity to help about 40 students in the most dire need, particularly those who are homeless or from extremely low-income families.
“I know we are not alone, as I imagine most organizations serving children and youth in SF are planning for the same thing,” Yagi said.
There’s more capacity at the Boys & Girls Clubs of San Francisco, which may be able to take in about 1,200 kids.
“We are in active conversations with the district and partner organizations about how we might support families in the event of a strike,” President Rob Connolly said in a statement. “At this stage, any capacity would focus on serving youth who are already enrolled in our programs and would be based at our traditional Clubhouses.”
A spokesperson for the San Francisco Public Library denied any arrangement with the union for the library to take in kids beyond normal operations. Rec and Parks, also name-checked by the union in its town hall, also denied any arrangement to support students. The YMCA declined to comment.
Though the union’s plans for arranging child care are questionable, the likelihood of a strike seemed far greater after the town hall. The union asked its members to march in front of schools and to raise money through crowdfunding sites to pay workers while they’re out.
And then there was one last hint: A union official ended the town hall by saying, “See you all on the picket lines.”
