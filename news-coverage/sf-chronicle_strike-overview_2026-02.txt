SFUSD, teachers negotiating over weekend in effort to avert Monday strike

Latest: S.F. teachers strike imminent with no additional talks scheduled

Negotiators for San Francisco public teachers and school district officials returned to the bargaining table over the weekend in an effort to ward off a looming strike by the teachers union.

The San Francisco Unified School District and the United Educators of San Francisco have spent most of the past year bargaining but remain at loggerheads over raises, health care, class size, support for students with special education needs and other issues. If teachers walk off the job Monday, it will wreak havoc for the city's families, municipal government, local employers and child care providers.

Talks began at 2 p.m. and ended at 9:45 p.m. Saturday with no agreement on major issues, though negotiators reached a tentative agreement on sanctuary district policies, representatives of SFUSD and the union said. No talks were planned for Sunday.

Union negotiators "were disappointed that there's still little movement on wages, and there's still no fully paid family healthcare," they said in a statement Sunday. "There is nearly 1 day left until we go on strike for the schools we know our students deserve. Time is running out. The district needs to step up."

Though no further talks were planned, SFUSD representatives were prepared to return to the bargaining table Sunday "and negotiate for as long as it takes," the union said in a statement late Saturday.

"I am deeply frustrated and disheartened that we did not reach a tentative agreement," Superintendent Maria Su said in the statement. "I am encouraged by our shared commitment to support immigrant students and families."

After the two sides met Thursday for a few hours, union officials rejected the district's proposal and refused to meet at a scheduled Friday negotiation session. Officials with the teachers union told the Chronicle Friday that "given the proposal we received last night it was clear the district needed more time to prepare a serious offer," and that the union would call off the strike only if the two sides agreed on all the issues at stake.

"The only way I can pull the emergency brake on this bus is to have a full agreement," union President Cassondra Curiel previously told the Chronicle.

The strike, which teachers voted overwhelmingly to authorize on Jan. 31, would be the first in a half-century by the city's public school teachers. The union representing principals, assistant principals, program administrators and supervisors has voted to hold a sympathy strike starting Monday in support of the teachers union, as have members of SEIU 1021, which represents the district's clerks and janitors.

Members of the United Administrators of San Francisco authorized the sympathy strike by a "strong margin," officials said, adding that they believed it was the first strike of an administrative union in California.

District officials said that if teachers strike next week, schools will be closed. In a message to families on Saturday afternoon, the district said it was preparing "for all SFUSD schools to be closed to students" on Monday. Paper copies of learning packets were being distributed to community centers, libraries and school sites, the district said in the statement.

Pressure mounted Saturday, with the San Francisco Labor Council, AFL-CIO, which represents scores of affiliated unions and more than 100,000 working people across the city, endorsed the strike.

"San Francisco's educators are standing up not just for themselves, but for their students, their schools, and the communities they serve every day," said labor council Executive Director Kim Tavaglione. "When educators are pushed to the brink, the labor movement stands with them. This strike sanction makes clear that UESF has the full solidarity of organized labor in San Francisco."

Earlier this week, Superintendent Su said she is still focused on a deal, but to be prepared for all possibilities, schools would be closed.

"We are working hard with our educators to prevent this strike," she said, at the news conference. "I do not want a strike."

One of the biggest sticking points between the two camps is teacher pay and benefits.

The district is offering 2% raises each of the next three years, while teachers want a 9% raise over two years. An independent fact-finding report released Wednesday split the difference, recommending 6% over two years.

Negotiations also remain stalled over health care benefits. Teacher health coverage is provided by the district, but family health care benefits cost teachers about $1,200 per month and are expected to rise. The union wants a permanent commitment for full family coverage.

The negotiations come amid years of financial woes for the district that ultimately forced a state takeover.

As the Chronicle previously reported, the cost of the union's demands in the first year would reportedly be more than $161 million and increase to $240 million by year three, district officials said. The city's schools have been facing a fiscal crisis for years, spending far more than they get in revenue.

The financial situation got so bad in the past year that the state intervened and assigned fiscal trustees who have the power to veto school board spending to ensure the district remains solvent. Ultimately, any agreement between the two sides must be approved by those trustees.

"We remain committed to negotiating throughout the weekend, beginning at 2:00 p.m. today, to reach an agreement so we can avoid a strike," SFUSD spokesperson Laura Dudnick said in a statement Saturday. "We will continue to pursue a win-win proposal that provides fiscal certainty for the district by matching spending to available resources, while delivering compensation directly to educators."

Dudnick said the district's current proposal "reflects the needs of all educators and keeps the district on a clear runway to exit state oversight" and was responsive to the teachers union's stated priorities.

The district has presented multiple proposals to the teachers union but hasn't received a counteroffer to this week's latest proposal.

In the event of a strike, the city plans to hand out free meals to all students 18 and younger on a first come, first served basis.

Emily de Ayora, spokesperson for San Francisco Parents Coalition, said Saturday morning that parents want teachers to be well paid and have affordable healthcare, but also want their children in school.

"We think both of those things can be true," she said. "We believe that both sides can come together without a strike."
