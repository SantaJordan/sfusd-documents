Audit of S.F. school district finances raises as many questions as it answers

The San Francisco school district spent more of its budget on its central office than comparable districts across the state, according to a new analysis by city officials, but the report also shows the district has a lot more money than its peers and spends more per student in its classrooms.

The report offers political ammunition for those who have long held that the district overspends on top administrators and consultants, but the unusual analysis offers few details on where the money is actually going and whether the spending in San Francisco aligns with efforts to improve student performance and well-being.

The city's school district spent 25% of its budget on central administrative services, according to the city's Budget and Legislative Analyst, compared to a median of 18% among the five districts with similar enrollment: Oakland, Long Beach, Elk Grove (Sacramento County), Corona-Norco (Riverside County) and Fresno.

The biggest disparity was in instructional supervision and administration, with San Francisco spending $1,780 per student compared to $611 in the five other districts.

"We weren't concluding this was bad or good," said Fred Brousseau, the city's director of policy analysis for the Board of Supervisors. "It's different than the other districts that we used for comparison."

The report noted that the spending could reflect diverse policy decisions among the districts, including the use of teacher coaches and that San Francisco has chosen to develop curriculum, which other districts don't necessarily do, according to the analysis.

Overall, with a $977.9 million budget, the district spent $16,657 per student, including $4,182 on central administration and $12,657 on schools and classrooms.

The other districts spent a median of $14,113 per student overall, including $2,853 on central administration and $11,662 in schools and classrooms.

The analysis, however, included charter school students in the overall enrollment numbers, even though the budget numbers did not include the money designated for district-approved charter schools.

That would significantly change the overall spending by about $2,000 per student in San Francisco, given the district's nearly 7,000 charter school students, but not in Long Beach, where the district's enrollment of 70,000 includes 295 charter students.

Superintendent Matt Wayne noted that the analysis does not include significant budget reductions made in June to address a $125 million shortfall. That included $50 million in cuts to classrooms, in large part reflecting a decline in enrollment, as well as $40 million in cuts to support services, operations and administration.

It's unclear where the district now stands in comparison to the other districts. That said, Wayne is using the analysis to help inform whether the district is supporting schools in the way it should be.

He said he's already started to look at the numbers, including why the district spends significantly more on contractors connected to instructional support.

In part, that's explained by services provided by community organizations that fall under the central office, including after-school services, he said.

"It's centrally managed because we don't want our schools to have to individually do contracts," Wayne said in an exclusive interview with The Chronicle. "We don't need six contracts with the YMCA."

That's unlikely to change, even if it would reduce the spending attributed to the central office, he said.

The budget coding used by the analysis doesn't have that level of detail.

"You need to look deeper than just the codes," he said. "We don't want to do something administratively just to look better."

Wayne said the report offers helpful information on where to look at spending -- whether that's because the district spends more or less than other districts.

Currently, San Francisco spends less than comparable districts on school sites in terms of maintenance, custodial services and upkeep. That could be an area where the school board might consider increasing central office expenditures, he said.

Supervisor Hillary Ronen requested the independent analysis of district expenditures after school board members and others raised questions about spending on top administrators, consultants and other non-classroom items.

She said the report was done in collaboration with district officials, who reviewed the data prior to the report's release, according to Brousseau.

"We believe this report shows that SFUSD's Central Office may be overstaffed in some areas and understaffed in others," Ronen said via text message. "We are excited that the new leadership at the District can use this tool along with their own fresh eyes to reorganize the Central Office to best benefit students, educators and families in the District."

The budget comparison among districts is uncommon, given the wide latitude districts have, not only in terms of how they spend much of their revenue, but also how they code that spending in formal accounting. Spending on coaches for teachers comes from the central office in San Francisco, even though those individuals work at school sites. Other districts might include coaches in school site budgets.

The state fiscal expert assigned to help guide the district through budget shortfalls from overspending in past years cautioned the school board last year that simple budget comparisons among districts does not provide the kind of deep analysis needed to determine whether staffing and spending is adequate or excessive, depending on the needs of each district.

Public education spending and budgeting is extremely complicated in California, with districts getting money from a wide range of sources -- from the federal and state government as well as nonprofit grants, parcel taxes and, in San Francisco's case, significant funding from the city to pay for art, music, libraries, preschool and other programs.

Some of the money can be spent on whatever the district and school board want to use it for, while other funding is restricted, meaning it can only be spent on designated costs, like special education, school lunches and after-school programs.

The analysis provides some direction to ensure money is flowing to help improve student outcomes.

"I wanted someone to look at it," said school board member Matt Alexander, who questioned central office spending during the budget process last summer. "I don't think the assumption is that because (spending) is different from another school district it's wasteful."

Instead, he said, "it raises lots of questions that will need to be explored."
