On Thursday morning at Marshall Elementary School in the Mission, dropoffs proceeded as usual. Kids shuffled out of school buses and Subarus and hopped off e-bikes and scooters. Parents bantered, coffee in hand, before heading off to work.
What was unusual: Parents were learning in real-time that San Francisco teachers had
announced
they intend to strike for the first time in 47 years. Barring an 11th-hour breakthrough in negotiations, school would be canceled for the foreseeable future starting Monday.
The Standard spoke with more than a dozen parents of elementary kids, and all said they support teachers’ decision to strike. Despite the logistical headaches a strike would bring, the parents didn’t direct their frustration at the United Educators of San Francisco. Many clutched flyers offering ways to help the union’s efforts, including details on educators’ demands and a standing offer to join the picket line.

When asked about the San Francisco Unified School District’s claims of a financial crisis, Griselda Martinez, a 39-year-old caregiver whose kids are in the second and third grades at Marshall, didn’t buy it. “I think that’s BS, honestly,” she said. “They have a lot of money for other stuff.”
The comment was echoed by other parents, many of whom said they believe teachers’ claims of struggling to get by in a city with an extremely high cost of living.
However, those opinions conflict with what the San Francisco Parent Coalition, which bills itself as the city’s largest parent advocacy group, said about Thursday’s strike announcement — describing it as “the wrong call.”

“This is not the time to escalate,” said Executive Director Meredith Dodson. “This is the time to come together and do everything we can to avoid disruption for our students. We’re hearing a lot of confusion from parents about why that’s not the focus and why the strike announcement came anyway.”
Many parents disagree.
“I think there is plenty of money in our government,” said Ty, father of a kindergartener at Clarendon Elementary in Forest Knolls, who declined to give his last name. “Defund the cops, pay the teachers.”
Stacy Boyer, mother of a fifth grader at Clarendon, said Mayor Daniel Lurie should step in to take responsibility for resolving the impasse between teachers and the district.

“Teachers work so hard,” Boyer said. “Whatever they are asking for, I am completely 100% behind them.”
A
neutral fact-finding report
, released Wednesday, argued that the district does not have the funding to support raises of 9% or more, as the union has demanded. The report instead recommended raises of 6% over a two-year period. Negotiations between the union and the district were set to continue Thursday evening.
Gerry Phung, mom of a Clarendon kindergartner, said the district has been due for a strike for years because of ongoing staffing shortages in special education. “It has to happen,” Phung said.
The report agreed that the district needs to switch from a caseload model to a workload model for special education, meaning educators would be assigned tasks based on how much time and effort each student requires, rather than being assigned a certain number of students.
Justin Lin, a 47-year-old software engineer whose kids are in the second and fifth grades at Clarendon, said he is most concerned about dependent healthcare costs paid by teachers — another sticking point in the negotiations — which some report can reach $1,400 a month.
At Clarendon, one parent said she’d keep her kid at home in case of a strike, as she works remotely. Another said he’d arrange a playdate with a few of his kids’ friends. But most parents at Marshall are concerned about child care. Nearly 80% of students there qualify for free or reduced lunch, as do 23% at Clarendon.
Rigo Ochoa, a 37-year-old electrician whose kids are in the second and fourth grades at Marshall, said he wants teachers to get the “benefits and rights” they deserve but is concerned that the strike will be bad for his family, since they “are working all of the time.”
“If the kids don’t have school, it affects our family,” he said. “If [the strike] takes more than a week, we will have to do something.”
