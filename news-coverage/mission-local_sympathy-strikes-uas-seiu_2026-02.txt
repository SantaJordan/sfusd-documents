In the event that San Francisco public school teachers
walk off the job
on Monday, principals and administrators announced today that they will strike in solidarity.
The 253 principals, assistant principals, program administrators and supervisors “voted by a strong margin to authorize this sympathy strike,” wrote United Administrators of San Francisco president Anna Klafter.
“We recognize that school closures — even temporary ones — are disruptive and stressful for families. However, as long as educators remain on the picket line, there is no safe way to operate schools as usual.”
In addition to principals and administrators, the clerks and custodians represented by the SEIU 1021 union have also authorized a sympathy strike.
Superintendent Maria Su today announced that in the event of a strike on Monday, all school sites will close. Plans to
disseminate food
to families reliant upon school breakfasts and lunches will rely upon third-party sites, as will after-school programs.
At this morning’s press conference, Su broke down in tears after announcing that the district has not been able to reach an agreement with the teachers union. It is unclear if schools will open on Monday even if the parties come to an agreement over the weekend.
Su today said that the union yesterday declined to provide a counteroffer. An SFUSD communique said that, on Thursday evening,  the district’s bargaining team offered two options for health benefits, neither of which are fully funded, in addition to an offer of a six percent raise over the course of three years. The union refused this offer.
The principals and administrators union, like the teachers,
threatened
a strike last year. It was averted in October following a
marathon bargaining session
.
“A single administrator alone in a school building does not constitute a functioning or safe school environment. Under these conditions, keeping schools open puts students at risk,” wrote Klafter.
“Temporarily closing schools and providing childcare through city partnerships is the most responsible option at this time. UASF members stand ready to return immediately and lead our school communities as soon as the strike concludes. Until then, we will stand in solidarity on the picket line.”
The district and the teachers union are next slated to meet on Saturday at 2 p.m. The district on Friday said that the union declined to meet this morning. In a statement posted yesterday evening, the union stated that it will not meet with the district until the SFUSD is ready to present a “serious offer.”
