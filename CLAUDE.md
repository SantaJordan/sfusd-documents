# SFUSD District Document Library

Raw materials and analysis outputs for SFUSD spending, labor agreements, and the 2026 UESF strike.

## Supplemental Contract Archive

The `analysis/contracts/` directory is **git-ignored** (3.0 GB, ~1,181 PDFs). It contains vendor contracts from 64 SFUSD contracts and 180 peer California school districts, used for cross-district vendor payment comparison.

**You must download it before working with contract data:**

```bash
pip install gdown
gdown "https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1fSnfhrYENywoUJ9dKh3x-BEutuC4s6pZ" -O analysis/contracts.zip
unzip analysis/contracts.zip -d analysis/contracts/
rm analysis/contracts.zip
```
