# SFUSD Forensic Financial Analysis: Where the Money Goes

**A Data-Driven Case for Maximizing Teacher Salary Increases**
**February 2026**

---

## Executive Summary

SFUSD teachers (UESF) began their strike on February 9, 2026. The district offers 2%/year for 3 years (6% total, Year 3 conditional), in exchange for eliminating AP prep periods, sabbatical leave, department head stipends, and enforceable class size caps. The independent PERB fact-finding panel recommended **3%/year for 2 years** (6% unconditional) -- more than the district is offering. UESF demands 9% certificated / 14% classified over 2 years plus $14M/year for family healthcare.

**Each 1% raise for all employees costs $10.17M/year** (PERB fact-finding report, Feb 2026).

**Core question:** Where can the district find money to fund substantially larger raises?

### Five Core Findings

| # | Finding | Key Number |
|---|---------|-----------|
| 1 | EMPowerSF payroll debacle | **$33.7M wasted** -- 3.3% in raises, thrown away on failed IT |
| 2 | Budget projections not credible | **$167M miss** -- projected $301M ending balance, actual was $468M |
| 3 | Parcel tax with no audit | **$50.6M/year** -- QTEA audit 3 years delinquent |
| 4 | Retiree health vs. current workers | **$3.6B unfunded OPEB** vs. $1,429/mo Kaiser premiums |
| 5 | Admin spending above peers | **15.1% vs. 10.5%** = $122M gap |

## 1. Administrative Spending: SFUSD vs. Peer Districts

**Source:** FY2024-25 Budget data, California SACS statewide extract

Admin spending = SACS Function codes 2100-2150, 7100-7700 (Instructional Supervision & Admin, Board & Superintendent, General Administration, Fiscal Services, HR, Central Support, Data Processing).

| District | Admin Spending | Total Expenditures | Admin % |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|---------|
| **San Francisco Unified** | **$402.8M** | **$2,661.0M** | **15.1%** |
| Los Angeles Unified | $2,842.2M | $21,560.6M | 13.2% |
| San Jose Unified | $116.4M | $990.2M | 11.8% |
| Long Beach Unified | $287.6M | $2,600.2M | 11.1% |
| Sacramento City Unified | $178.3M | $1,632.3M | 10.9% |
| Fresno Unified | $293.6M | $3,438.3M | 8.5% |
| San Diego Unified | $317.1M | $3,947.6M | 8.0% |
| Oakland Unified | $140.3M | $1,794.3M | 7.8% |
| **Peer Median** | -- | -- | **~10.5%** |

If SFUSD matched the peer median, it would free up **~$122M/year**. Even closing half the gap frees $61M = 6% raises for all employees.

### BLA Findings (January 2023)
- Central admin = **25% of operating budget** ($978M in FY2020-21) vs. 18% median among 12 peer districts
- **220 central FTEs per 10,000 students** vs. 138 median (59% more admin staff)
- $1,780/student on instructional supervision vs. $611/student peer median
- $104.5M on instructional supervision vs. $27.5M peer median = **$77M excess**

### UESF "Restructure it Right" Report (Feb 2024)
- 168 high-level admin positions added since 2009 costing **$34M/year**
- $394/student on central supervisory staff vs. $201 state average (nearly double)
- 27-person enrollment center -- comparable districts have none

## 2. Contractor & Consultant Spending: Top 25 Vendors

**Total vendor payments: $226M**

PERB panel stated: *"The District must continue to reduce its reliance on outside consultants and thus reallocate the contracting out funds to programs that directly benefit their employees."*

| 4 | Bay Area Community Resources | $10,472,532 | After-school programs |
| 5 | Galaxy Solutions Inc. | $7,056,413 | IT consulting |
| 6 | Mission Graduates | $5,924,049 | After-school programs |

| 16 | Special Service for Groups | $2,567,370 | Social services |
| 17 | Gold Star Foods Inc. | $2,530,170 | Food services |
| 18 | RCM Technologies | $2,500,540 | Healthcare staffing |
| 19 | Source to Target Translations | $2,430,000 | Translation services |
| 20 | Community Youth Center of SF | $2,130,344 | After-school programs |
| 21 | Aequor | $2,003,500 | Healthcare staffing |
| 22 | Real Options for City Kids | $1,986,066 | After-school programs |
| 23 | CDW Government | $1,715,567 | IT equipment |
| 24 | Pioneer Healthcare Services | $1,570,000 | Healthcare staffing |
| 25 | Amergis Healthcare Staffing | $1,544,333 | Healthcare staffing |

**Contractor Categories:**
- Healthcare staffing contractors: **$20M+** (Speech Pathology Group $5.85M, Ro Health $4.35M, RCM $2.5M, Aequor $2M, Pioneer $1.57M, Amergis $1.54M...)
- IT consulting & systems: **$18M+** (Galaxy $7M, Infosys $5.75M, Protiviti $5.55M, SAP $1.05M...)
- After-school programs: **$39M+** (YMCA $14.4M, BACR $10.5M, Mission Grad $5.9M, Jamestown $3.4M...)

## 3. The EMPowerSF Debacle: $33.7M+ Wasted on Payroll

**Timeline:**
- **2018:** SFUSD contracts Infosys/SAP for $13.7M to build "EMPowerSF" payroll/HR system
- **2019-2022:** System never works properly. BLA finds it drove a $13M (28%) increase in Centralized Data Processing costs
- **2023:** District abandons EMPowerSF and contracts Frontline Education for a replacement (~$20M estimated total)
- **2026:** District proposes forcing classified staff onto Frontline's bimonthly pay system as a contract demand

> **Total waste: $33.7M+** for a payroll system that peers operate for a fraction of the cost. That's equivalent to a **3.3% raise for every employee**, thrown away on a failed IT project.

---

## 4. Budget Variance: Systematic Under-Projection of Fund Balances

SFUSD's 1st Interim Reports -- the official budget projections filed with the state each December -- have **systematically understated the General Fund ending balance by tens to hundreds of millions of dollars**. This is not a one-time miss; it is a multi-year pattern that undermines every "we can't afford it" claim.

### Projected vs. Actual: General Fund Ending Balance

Each December, the district files a 1st Interim Report projecting the year's ending fund balance. Here's what they projected vs. what actually happened:

| Fiscal Year | 1st Interim Projected | Actual Ending Balance | Difference | Miss % |
|-------------|----------------------|----------------------|------------|--------|
| FY2021-22 | $313.2M | $274.7M | -$38.5M | Over by 14%* |
| FY2022-23 | $307.2M | $413.3M | **+$106.1M** | **Under by 35%** |
| FY2023-24 | $383.4M | $467.9M | **+$84.5M** | **Under by 22%** |
| FY2024-25 | $286.4M | TBD | -- | -- |

*FY2021-22 was inflated by one-time COVID relief (ESSER) funds. Out-year projections from this report were still dramatically pessimistic.*

**Sources:** Projected figures from SACS Form MYPI in each year's 1st Interim Report; actuals from the following year's 1st Interim beginning fund balance.

### Out-Year Projections: Even More Wrong

The district's 2-year-out forecasts -- the ones used to justify austerity and cuts -- were off by **$100M+** every time:

| Projected FY | From Which Report | Projected Ending | Actual Ending | Miss |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| FY2022-23 | FY2021-22 1st Interim | $325.9M | $413.3M | **+$87.4M** |
| FY2023-24 | FY2021-22 1st Interim | $346.0M | $467.9M | **+$121.9M** |
| FY2023-24 | FY2022-23 1st Interim | $300.8M | $467.9M | **+$167.1M** |

The FY2022-23 1st Interim projected that by FY2023-24, the ending balance would be just $300.8M. The actual was $467.9M -- **$167 million more than projected**.

### Current Dire Projections (Dec 2024 & Dec 2025)

The district now projects near-zero fund balances within 2 years -- the same type of projections that were off by $100M+ in every prior year:

**FY2024-25 1st Interim (Negative Certification):**
| Projected FY | Projected Ending Balance |
|---|---|
| FY2025-26 | $71.0M |
| FY2026-27 | **$7.9M** |

**Fiscal Stabilization Plan (Dec 2025):**
| Fiscal Year | Projected Unrestricted Deficit |
|-------------|-------------------------------|
| FY 2025-26 | -$51.5M |
| FY 2026-27 | -$32.4M |
| FY 2027-28 | -$19.5M |

> **The pattern is clear:** The district projects fiscal catastrophe, then ends the year with tens to hundreds of millions more than projected. These deficit projections do NOT include any negotiated compensation increases -- meaning the district projects deficits even at 0% raises. Given the track record ($106M miss in FY2022-23, $85M miss in FY2023-24, $167M miss on out-year projections), the current dire projections should be discounted accordingly.

### 1st Interim Certifications: Deteriorating on Paper, Not in Reality

| Fiscal Year | Certification | What Actually Happened |
|---|---|---|
| FY2021-22 | Positive | Ended $274.7M (healthy) |
| FY2022-23 | Positive | Ended $413.3M (massive surplus) |
| FY2023-24 | Qualified | Ended $467.9M (even larger surplus) |
| FY2024-25 | **Negative** | TBD -- but began with $468.2M |

The certifications got progressively worse (Positive -> Qualified -> Negative) while actual ending balances got progressively *higher* ($274.7M -> $413.3M -> $467.9M).

### Historical Surpluses (SACS Actuals)

| Fiscal Year | Revenue | Expenditures | Net Surplus |
|-------------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| FY2020-21 | $988.8M | $923.9M | **+$64.9M** |
| FY2021-22 | $1,310.6M | $1,162.1M | **+$148.5M** (incl. COVID funds) |

### SF Bay Area CPI: 2% Raises Don't Keep Pace

The BLS CPI for San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward (CPI-U) as of December 2025 is **3.0% year-over-year**. The district's proposed 2%/year raise means teachers lose purchasing power every year. Key sub-categories: Food +4.3%, Shelter +1.7%, Transportation +4.5%, Tuition/Child Care +4.3%.

## 5. Salary Spending: SFUSD vs. Peer Districts

| District | Cert. Salaries | Class. Salaries | Total Expend. | Salary % |
|----------|---------------|----------------|--------------|----------|
| San Diego Unified | $1,585.8M | $615.9M | $3,947.6M | 55.8% |
| **San Francisco Unified** | **$975.8M** | **$442.8M** | **$2,661.0M** | **53.3%** |
| Los Angeles Unified | $8,036.6M | $3,051.9M | $21,560.6M | 51.4% |
| Long Beach Unified | $1,022.5M | $288.8M | $2,600.2M | 50.4% |
| San Jose Unified | $371.9M | $124.4M | $990.2M | 50.1% |
| Sacramento City Unified | $616.9M | $183.0M | $1,632.3M | 49.0% |
| Fresno Unified | $1,185.6M | $448.0M | $3,438.3M | 47.5% |
| Oakland Unified | $545.6M | $263.7M | $1,794.3M | 45.1% |

SFUSD's salary percentage (53.3%) is above average -- but the issue is *where non-salary money goes*: admin overhead and outside consultants rather than direct student services.

## 6. Parcel Tax Accountability Gaps

| Tax | Annual Revenue | Expires | Status |
|-----|---------------|---------|--------|
| QTEA (Prop A, 2008) | ~$50.6M/year | June 30, 2028 | **FY22-23 audit 3 YEARS DELINQUENT** |
| PEEF/FWEA (Prop J, 2020) | ~$53.7M/year | 2038 | FY24-25 report not published |

> **QTEA compliance audit for FY 2022-23 is nearly 3 years delinquent** -- still listed as "Coming Soon" on the SFUSD website. The district can't produce a compliance audit for $50.6 million of voter-approved parcel tax money.

Key concerns:
- QTEA expires June 30, 2028 -- just 2.5 years away
- 75% of parcel tax currently funds UESF salary increases
- Redirecting to health benefits means less for salaries
- Health benefits would be in a side MOU (not the CBA) -- easier to modify or end

---

## 7. Healthcare Cost Explosion

### Kaiser Employee+2 Total Monthly Premium (from SFHSS rate cards)

| Plan Year | Total Monthly Cost | Employee Biweekly | SFUSD Biweekly |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| 2024 | $2,349/mo | $189.58 | $899.40 |
| 2025 | $2,489/mo | $185.26 | $962.59 |
| 2026 | $2,733/mo | $216.16 | $1,045.25 |

**District healthcare totals:**
- Active employee healthcare: **$33.2M/year**
- Retiree healthcare (OPEB pay-as-you-go): **$34.4M/year**
- OPEB unfunded actuarial accrued liability: **$3.6 BILLION**

UESF demands $14M/year for fully funded family healthcare. The district estimates the cost at $11M/year (PERB fact-finding, p.9).

## 8. FY2025-26 Expenditure Breakdown

From the December 2025 Fiscal Stabilization Plan (~$1.3B total):

| Category | Amount | % of Total |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Instruction | $751.8M | 58% |
| Student Services | $198.4M | 15% |
| Instruction-related | $150.8M | 12% |
| Building & Grounds | $116.0M | 9% |
| General Administration | $72.2M | 6% |
| Ancillary | $6.8M | 1% |
| Other Outgo | $4.3M | <1% |

---

## 9. The Maximum Salary Argument

| Funding Source | Annual $ Available | Raises Funded | Confidence |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------|------------|
| Cut admin to peer median (50% of gap) | $61M | 6.0% | **HIGH** |
| Reduce consultant/contractor spending | $15-25M | 1.5-2.5% | **HIGH** |
| EMPowerSF waste recovery | $3-5M/yr | 0.3-0.5% | MEDIUM |
| Fund balance surplus (recurring) | $15-25M | one-time bonus | **HIGH** |
| Parcel tax for health benefits (MOU) | $14M | frees salary pot | **HIGH** |
| School consolidation savings (phased) | $10-25M | 1.0-2.5% | MEDIUM |
| Bond fund cost absorption | $5-10M | 0.5-1.0% | MEDIUM |
| **Conservative Total** | **$123M** | **~12.1%** | |
| **Optimistic Total** | **$175M** | **~17.2%** | |

> Even the conservative estimate of $123M (~12.1%) exceeds UESF's 9% certificated salary demand with room for healthcare funding and classified raises.

**The question is not "Can SFUSD afford raises?" -- it's "Why does SFUSD choose to spend money on administration, failed IT projects, and consultants instead of the people who teach children?"**

## 10. SFUSD Function-Level Breakdown (FY2024-25)

Top General Fund spending by SACS function code:

| Code | Function | Amount | |
|------|----------|--------|-|
| 1000 | Instruction | $1,202.4M | |
| 2100 | Instructional Supervision & Admin | $172.8M | **ADMIN** |
| 2700 | School Administration | $122.0M | |
| 8200 | Operations | $95.8M | |
| 3130 | Attendance/Social Work | $89.8M | |
| 1120 | SpEd Resource Specialist | $81.8M | |
| 3600 | Pupil Transportation | $81.5M | |
| 1110 | SpEd Separate Classes | $80.3M | |
| 7400 | Personnel/Human Resources | $75.7M | **ADMIN** |
| 7700 | Centralized Data Processing | $58.2M | **ADMIN** |
| 3110 | Guidance/Counseling | $49.8M | |
| 1180 | SpEd Nonpublic | $48.0M | |
| 7150 | Superintendent | $29.2M | **ADMIN** |
| 7300 | Fiscal Services | $19.8M | **ADMIN** |
| 7200 | Other General Admin | $7.6M | **ADMIN** |

## 11. Governance & Transparency Failures

| Issue | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Late Audit (FY 2021-22) | Approved **two years late** (March 2024) |
| Late Audit (FY 2022-23) | Submitted late to CDE |
| FCMAT Risk Assessment | No position control, contra accounts used improperly, budget monitoring failures |
| Negative Certification | May 2024 |
| "Lack of Going Concern" | Designation triggered FCMAT review |
| Budget Book Volume I | Never published |
| QTEA FY22-23 Audit | Nearly **3 years delinquent** |
| PEEF FY24-25 Report | Not yet published |
| Per-Pupil Accounting | Can only account for 47% of GF expenditures in per-pupil reports |

> A district that can't account for 53% of its per-pupil spending, misses its own budget projections by $100M+, got a "lack of going concern" designation, and can't produce a required compliance audit for a $50M/year parcel tax **doesn't have credibility on affordability claims**.
