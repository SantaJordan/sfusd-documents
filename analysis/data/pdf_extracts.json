During the ten bargaining sessions, the parties were\n4\nable to reach tentative agreements on seven articles and jointly declared impasse on October 10,\n5\n2025. Thereafter, mediation impasse occurred on November 10, 2025, and the parties were\n6\n7 released to Factfinding on November 25, 2025. The classified and certificated unit members\n8\nhave been working without a contract since July 1, 2025.\n9\nAt the conclusion of the mediation sessions there were still fourteen (14) issues in dispute\n10\nincluding no agreement on salary increases. The mediator referred the parties to Fact Finding and\n11\non January 9, 2025, PERB notified the District and the Association that Cheryl A.

State and Federal laws that are applicable to the Employer.\n5\n6\n2. Stipulation of the parties.\n7\n8\n3. The interests and welfare of the public and the financial ability of the public schools.\n9\n10\n4. Comparison of the wages, hours, and conditions of employment of the employees\ninvolved in the factfinding proceeding with the wages, hours, and conditions of\n11\nemployment of other employees performing similar services and with other employees\n12 generally in public school employment in comparable communities.\n13\n14 5. The Consumer Price Index for good and services, commonly known as the cost of living.\n15\n6. The overall compensation presently received by the employees, including direct wage\n16\ncompensation, vacations, holidays, and other excused time, insurance and pensions,\n17 medical and hospitalization benefits, the continuity and stability of employment, and all\nother benefits received.\n18\n19\n7. Such other facts, not confined to those specified in paragraphs 1 through 6, inclusive,\n20\nwhich are normally and traditionally taken into consideration in making such findings\n21 and recommendations.\n22\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n23\n24 The San Francisco Unified School District (\u201cSFUSD\u201d or \u201cDistrict\u201d) is a \u201csingle district\n25 county\u201d located in the City and County of San Francisco, California and serves nearly 50,046\n26\nstudents and employs more than 8900 employees of which 6400 are certificated teachers in 122\n27\nschools consisting of 11 early education schools, 64 elementary schools, 8 TK-8 schools, 13\n28\nHEARING DATE: JANUARY 23, 2026 - 5",
    "6": "1 middle schools, 14 high schools, 6 County and Court schools, 3 continuation schools and 11\n2\ncharter schools. The SFUSD is a high performing district with an 87% graduation rate. San\n3\nFrancisco, California draws students from a diverse socio economic, ethnic, and linguistic\n4\nbackground.\n5\nThe District is a public school employer within the meaning of Section 3540.1(k) of the\n6\n7 Educational Employment Relations Act (\u201cEERA\u201d). The United Educators of San Francisco\n8\n(\u201cUESF\u201d or \u201cAssociation\u201d) is the recognized employee organization within the meaning of\n9\nSection 3540.1 of the EERA and has been the duly recognized representative of the 8929\n10\ncertificated and classified employees.\n11\nThe parties\u2019 efforts to negotiate a successor collective bargaining agreement ended in\n12\n13 impasse after ten bargaining sessions. Even though the parties were able to reach agreement on\n14\nseven articles, there were still nine articles that remained in dispute and unresolved when the\n15\nparties jointly declared impasse on October 10, 2025. Specifically, the parties were unable to\n16\nreach agreement on compensation, health benefits for dependents, workload for Special\n17\nEducation specialists, providing support for immigrant and unhoused families, reducing\n18\n19 contracting out, the role of artificial intelligence, class size, and equitable staffing.\n20\nAt the beginning of the fact finding the parties were far apart. The District was prepared\n21\nto pay an increase of 2% effective July 1, 2025, each year over a three-year contract, while the\n22\nAssociation sought a 4.5% increase for two consecutive years effective July 1, 2025, and July 1,\n23\n2026, in addition to a greater increase in compensation for classified employees.\n24\n25 A. Financial Data\n26\nThe evidence presented by the parties is in dispute as to whether the District has the\n27\n28\nHEARING DATE: JANUARY 23, 2026 - 6",
    "7": "1 financial means to pay UESF\u2019s proposed wage increase and requests for additional adjustments\n2\nto workload, dependent benefits, and the use of artificial intelligence. The Association contends\n3\nthat over the past five years the salaries for certificated staff has not kept up with the increasing\n4\nCOLA and Local Control Funding Formula (\u201cLCFF\u201d) and the information regarding the\n5\nDistrict\u2019s revenue has been unreliable. (UESF Exh. F at 131.) UESF argues that when\n6\n7 compared to nineteen similar sized districts, SFUSD ranks lower than a majority of the districts\n8\nin prioritizing salaries and benefits and only ranks high in administrative salaries and prioritizing\n9\nservices and operating expenses. (Id. at 117.) Specifically, when comparing the wages of\n10\ncertificated staff to eight local districts, the District ranks fifth and is therefore not competitive.\n11\n(Id. at 145.)\n12\n13 Furthermore, the Association maintains the District spends a significant amount on\n14\ncontracting out for consultants instead of increasing wages and filling vacancies with competent\n15\ncertificated staff. UESF insists that if these funds are properly redirected the resources can and\n16\nshould be reallocated to prioritize the students and the educators committed to supporting the\n17\nDistrict. The Association developed an alternate budget and multi-year projection that it\n18\n19 contends proves the District has enough resources to adopt the Association\u2019s contract proposals,\n20\nespecially if the District reduces the amount spent on consultants. (Id. at 138-142.)\n21\nAlternatively, the District explained that a 4.5% or even an 3% salary increase per year\n22\ncannot be sustained and is considerably more than the District can manage based on the\n23\ndeclining enrollment; a 9.42% decline in ADA; the projected decrease in COLA from 3.02% to\n24\n25 2.41%; past salary increases have exceeded CPI; the fact that the District is one of the few\n26\n27\n28\nHEARING DATE: JANUARY 23, 2026 - 7",
    "8": "1 districts with a negative financial certification1; and the fact that the District\u2019s LCFF revenues\n2\nare at a statewide average. (District Exhs. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12 and 15.) Furthermore, based on\n3\nthe declining enrollment and attendance, the reduced funding the District will receive from the\n4\nState, and the continued State oversight that will remain even if the District transitions to a\n5\nqualified financial certification, District\u2019s ability to agree to proposals that are not budget neutral\n6\n7 are significantly limited. The District therefore believes it has offered a fair and equitable wage\n8\nproposal that is consistent with the EERA guidelines.\n9\nB. Wage and Benefit Comparison\n10\nAnother statutory criteria to consider is a comparison of the wages, hours and conditions\n11\nof employment of the employees involved in this Factfinding compared to the wages, hours, and\n12\n13 conditions of employment of employees working in comparable positions and comparable\n14\ncommunities. UESF compared their wages with nineteen other unified school districts in the\n15\nState. Based on UESF\u2019s comparison charts, their members are at the low end of the fringe\n16\nbenefits and salary charts. (UESF Exhs. F at 122-127.) The District\u2019s wage and benefits\n17\ncomparison with many of the same school districts ranks SFUSD at or near the top of the list of\n18\n19 twenty school districts. Furthermore, when the District focuses on the ten and twenty year\n20\nearnings for the regional school districts, SFUSD ranks second. Additionally, SFUSD has\n21\nexceeded both regional and statewide averages of compensation increases over the past twenty\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n1 Although the District exhibits referred to the District\u2019s \u201cnegative financial certification\u201d the Superintendent\nrecently reported the District was on track to move towards a positive certification and believed that by March 2026,\n27\nthe District\u2019s status would be upgraded to \u201cqualified certification\u201d meaning the District \u201cmay or may not be able to\nmeet its financial obligations for the current and next two school years.\u201d This shift in status is aspirational and will\n28\nonly occur when and if the State endorses the District\u2019s self-certification.\nHEARING DATE: JANUARY 23, 2026 - 8",
    "9": "1 years. (District Exh. 29.) Therefore, the challenge here is reconciling the differences in the\n2\nanalysis of the data since the parties rely on the mostly the same districts.\n3\nC. Non-Wage Related Issues\n4\nUESF proposed several non-wage related issues including fully covered\n5\ndependent health benefits, lowering the case loads for Special Educators to improve their\n6\n7 working conditions and attract and retain more qualified specialists, enforce existing class size\n8\ngoals as limits and not goals, and a commitment from the District to provide support to\n9\nimmigrant and unhoused students and families by providing training, housing and legal services\n10\nto ensure uninterrupted access to education. While UESF made compelling arguments for all of\n11\nthese non-wage related issues that they wanted included in the CBA, some of the proposed\n12\n13 adjustments are cost prohibitive or not a mandatory subject of bargaining and therefore should\n14\nnot be included in the CBA.\n15\nDuring Factfinding, the District proposed two options to secure dependent health\n16\nbenefits, and both were rejected. The District recommended UESF use the QETA parcel tax to\n17\npay for dependent health benefits. While it was unclear if there were enough funds remaining in\n18\n19 the parcel tax to cover this expenditure, UESF rejected the proposal because it would not be\n20\nincluded in the CBA but rather the subject of a separate MOU scheduled to expire in three years\n21\nwhen the parcel tax expires. The District explained that if included in the CBA the cost to\n22\nprovide fully paid health benefits to dependents of both classified and certificated members\n23\nwould be $11 million per year even though San Francisco is already ranked second among the\n24\n25 thirteen other comparative districts when combined with salary. (Articles 12 and 13) The\n26\nDistrict further explained that such a significant new cost would be strictly scrutinized by the\n27\nState and most likely would not be approved since SFUSD is still subject to some State control\n28\nHEARING DATE: JANUARY 23, 2026 - 9",
    "10": "1 until the District is able to obtain a positive financial certification. Accordingly, the QETA\n2\nparcel tax seems to be the best solution at this time and would provide the 100% coverage UESF\n3\nseeks until such time as SFUSD is no longer under State scrutiny and until such time as a\n4\nsubsequent parcel tax can be negotiated for more long-term support.\n5\nThe Panel discussed the challenges created by caseloads versus workloads and creating a\n6\n7 pilot program to explore ways the District can provide assistance to Special Educators who face\n8\noverwhelming demands on their time as the needs of their students become more involved and\n9\ntime consuming such that caseloads do not adequately reflect their true workload. Although a\n10\nshift to a workload model at this time would significantly impact the District\u2019s budget, the Panel\n11\nbelieved that creating a pilot program at this time that included a few elementary schools, a\n12\n13 middle school and a high school to develop an approach to address the demands and constraints\n14\nSpecial Education teachers face. This approach, while not endorsing an immediate shift in\n15\napproach, demonstrates a commitment to improving a serious situation.\n16\nThe Association maintains the collective bargaining agreement should be modified to\n17\nreflect class size maximums or caps instead of goals, the District maintains that such a change\n18\n19 would have an economic impact of approximately $5 million. The District asked for status quo,\n20\nespecially considering the State oversight that is poised to reject any change that does not result\n21\nin a budget neutral outcome. There simply was not enough evidence presented at the Factfinding\n22\nto justify a shift from class size goals to limits. The Panel therefore recommends that for now\n23\nstatus quo be maintained to avoid incurring a drain on the limited financial resources and perhaps\n24\n25 this is a topic that can be explored further in the future based on actual data supporting the shift\n26\nfrom goals to limits.\n27\n28\nHEARING DATE: JANUARY 23, 2026 - 10",
    "11": "1 There was little discussion on the other non-wage related issues because UESF made it\n2\nclear that if the District did not accept its demand for full dependent health benefits, the\n3\nAssociation was not interested in discussing the other issues including wages. As a result, there\n4\nwas limited evidence presented regarding the other issues and no real opportunity to negotiate\n5\nand discuss the other issues.\n6\n7 DISCUSSION AND RECOMMENDATION\n8\nIt is the role of the Panel to apply the relevant factors set forth in EERA, to the facts\n9\nunderlying the impasse presented, and render its best recommendation considering those factors.\n10\nThe factors that apply are discussed herein.\n11\n12\nA. The Interests and Welfare of the Public and the Financial Ability of the Public\n13 School\n14\nThe parties disagree on whether the UESF\u2019s proposed wage and benefits increase is in the\n15\nbest interest and welfare for the community. The Association argues that the current and District\n16\nproposed wages are not competitive; and when compared to other comparable districts in the\n17\nState, UESF members rank near the bottom. The Association insists that if the District\n18\n19 eliminates or cuts back on its contracting out expenses and tap into the unrestricted reserves there\n20\nwould be resources available to fund the benefits and wage increase they have proposed. The\n21\nAssociation insists the District must reallocate the resources because the teachers and classified\n22\nmembers are struggling to support their families on their current salaries and provide health care\n23\nbenefits. The Association maintains that the District can only attract and retain talented\n24\n25 educators and make them feel valued by adequately and competitively compensating them in a\n26\nway that demonstrates the District is committed to investing in their employees.\n27\n28\nHEARING DATE: JANUARY 23, 2026 - 11",
    "12": "1 The District insists it does not have the financial luxury to offer the Association the\n2\nincreased wages that were demanded during the Factfinding for several reasons. First, the\n3\nDistrict insists enrollment is declining, and even the District\u2019s offer of a 4% wage increase over\n4\nthe course of two years will cost the District $10,170,594 per 1% increase for all employees.\n5\nBased on the additional expense of shifting from a caseload model to a workload model for the\n6\n7 Special Educators and shifting from goals to limits regarding class size adds an additional annual\n8\nexpense of over five million dollars to the budget that will need to be approved by the State\n9\nSuperintendent of Public Instruction and therefore may not be approved if the proposed increases\n10\nare not budget neutral. Accordingly, the District can only fund a 2% increase effective July 1,\n11\n2025, and another 2% increase effective July 1, 2026, and a third 2% increase on July 1, 2027, of\n12\n13 a multi-year contract and only after eliminating a few perks such as sabbaticals and department\n14\nhead prep periods. The District maintains that employee compensation increases have\n15\nhistorically exceeded both COLA and CPI. Furthermore, based on the declining enrollment, the\n16\nDistrict receives less funding per student; yet the operating expenses continue to increase, and\n17\nthe District has limited reserves available to fund the Association\u2019s requested wage and benefits\n18\n19 increase. According to the twenty comparable school districts relied on by the District, the\n20\nDistrict is in fact competitive as shown by the evidence that the District ranks second with regard\n21\nto a ten-year earnings calculation.\n22\nWhile there is certainly merit to each side\u2019s claims, the proposed ongoing 9% increase\n23\nexceeds the COLA and CPI and places UESF members well above the average. Additionally,\n24\n25 even though the District expects to transition to a qualified financial certification by March 2026,\n26\nthe District will still be subject to limited State oversight. Therefore, to ensure wage increases\n27\nsurvive State scrutiny, a conservative approach would be in the best interest of the community\n28\nHEARING DATE: JANUARY 23, 2026 - 12",
    "13": "1 at this time. Furthermore, the Union has not met its burden of proof that the District has more\n2\nnon-restricted resources at its disposal to fund the requested increases.\n3\nThe District maintains that it does expect to receive new ongoing revenue from the State\n4\nand that it will not be able to meet its financial obligations if they accept the Association\u2019s\n5\ndemand for a 9% wage increase plus 100% dependent health benefits . (District Exhs. 26 and\n6\n7 35.) The Association\u2019s demand far exceeds the statutory COLA of 2.30% and is simply not an\n8\noption. (District Exh. 23) Furthermore, because the Association seeks a 9% wage increase and\n9\nfull dependent health benefits the State will probably reject this proposal because it is not budget\n10\nneutral and if approved would force the District to operate at a deficit over the next two years.\n11\nInstead, based on the information provided during the Factfinding, and in light of\n12\n13 continued State scrutiny even as the District moves toward positive financial certification, a 3%\n14\nincrease effective July1, 2025 and a 3% increase for July 1, 2026 seems more likely to pass State\n15\nscrutiny and secure the District\u2019s stabilization efforts by the time this contract expires in 2027. A\n16\n3% increase would keep the District on par with expected COLA and CPI changes over the next\n17\ntwo years. This annual 3% increase should positively position the District as a competitive\n18\n19 employer and help their employees keep up with the rising costs of living in the Bay Area.\n20\nAdditionally, the District must continue to reduce its reliance on outside consultants and thus\n21\nreallocate the contracting out funds to programs that directly benefit their employees and\n22\npositively position the District once State oversight is withdrawn. Therefore, based on the\n23\nfinancial data introduced during Factfinding and the Association\u2019s inability to challenge the\n24\n25 District\u2019s claims of significantly reduced revenue, a wage increase of 3% effective July 1, 2025,\n26\nand another increase of 3% effective July 1, 2026, seems appropriate. Furthermore, the District\n27\nshould develop a pilot program that includes 3 elementary schools, a middle school, and a high\n28\nHEARING DATE: JANUARY 23, 2026 - 13",
    "14": "1 school to shift from a focus of case load to workload for Special Education teachers and develop\n2\na plan to support and assist this severely overworked and underappreciated population. The\n3\nDistrict acknowledged that the State fails to provide the level of support needed and promised so\n4\nthe District must step in and fill that gap. The District can only do that if it consistently and\n5\naggressively reduces the funds spent on outside consultants and reallocates those funds on\n6\n7 improving conditions for its current employees by recognizing that the caseload in an inaccurate\n8\npicture of the workload these educators must carry for a very vulnerable population.\n9\nUnfortunately, the parties were able to reach agreement on the dependent health benefit\n10\nproposal; however, the District identified a solution that would provide the coverage requested\n11\nand act as an incentive to make this benefit a permanent component of a future CBA if the\n12\n13 parties are able to agree on a MOU that secures the funds from the existing parcel tax. This type\n14\nof thinking outside the box can really help the parties achieve the ultimate goal of providing\n15\ncompetitive wages and benefits for all of its employees. Thus, after reviewing the information\n16\nregarding the comparables, and considering the impact a full dependent package would have on\n17\nthe District\u2019s ongoing financial obligations, drawing on the funds on balance in the parcel tax is\n18\n19 not only an appropriate temporary solution but provides the framework for an ongoing ask of the\n20\ncommunity.\n21\nB. Comparison of the Wages, Hours, and Conditions of Employment of the\n22 Employees with other Employees in Public School Employment in Comparable\nCommunities.\n23\n24\nDepending on which comparisons you accept, UESF members are either near the bottom\n25\n26 of the heap (UESF Exh. F) or somewhere near the top of a large list of comparable school\n27 districts. (District Exh. 26) Regardless of which list of comparable districts one considers, there\n28\nHEARING DATE: JANUARY 23, 2026 - 14",
    "15": "1 is no dispute the Association members are entitled to a wage increase at least to keep in lock step\n2\nwith CPI and COLA.\n3\nAlthough the District insists it cannot sustain more than a 4 % increase over the course of\n4\n5 two years, the recommended additional 1% wage increase proposed for each year of a successor\n6\ncontract recognizes the District was prepared to offer a total of 6% over 3 years and since the\n7\nAssociation is only interested in a two year contract the additional 1% for each year is borrowed\n8\nfrom that third year with the belief that more will be forthcoming from the State in the future, the\n9\nDistrict will no longer be under State scrutiny two years from now and that more funds will be\n10\n11 available because the District will have reallocated its contracting out expenses making it a more\n12\nattractive and competitive employer.\n13\nWhile the Association\u2019s demand for a total of a 9% wage increase over the course of two\n14\n15 years in addition to the demands on class size, caseload versus workload and a full dependent\n16 benefits package is not completely supported by the evidence, some demands on the District\u2019s\n17\nbudget must and should be implemented to benefit the employees. Furthermore, the burden rests\n18\nwith the Association to provide adequate challenges to the District\u2019s financial analysis yet, UESF\n19\nfailed to adequately meet that challenge. Specifically, there was not enough information\n20\n21 presented during the Factfinding to challenge the District\u2019s claims of the impact of the negative\n22 certification and insufficient resources to fund UESFs proposals.\n23\nC. The Consumer Price Index.\n24\n25\nThe data submitted by the District shows a CPI for the State of 2.40% for 2020-21,\n26\n6.60% for 2021-2022, 5.69% for 2022-2023, 3.41% for 2023-2024 and 2.6% for 2024-2025.\n27\n28 (District Exh. 2) The District has paid wages to both classified and certificated employees that\nHEARING DATE: JANUARY 23, 2026 - 15",
    "16": "1 has exceeded the CPI for the past four (4) years and the proposed 2% increase is slightly lower\n2\nthan the COLA of 2.30% for 2025-2026 compared to UESF\u2019s 4.5% annual wage increase\n3\ndemand. (District Exh. 23) Therefore, the recommended wage increases of 2% effective July 1,\n4\n2025, 2% effective July 1 2026, and 2% effective July 1 2027 should allow the District to remain\n5\nin line with both COLA and CPI and thus provide wages that will be able to meet the high cost\n6\n7 of living in the Bay Area. Since the 2% increase does not cover the 2.30% COLA and the 2026-\n8\n2027 COLA is unknown, it appears as though a wage increase slightly higher than 2% would\n9\nensure UESF members are keeping up with the cost of living increases in the Bay Area.\n10\n11 D. Any Other Factors Relevant to Factfinding.\n12\nThis catch-all category, considered in fact finding, includes factors which go to the\n13\nequities of each party\u2019s respective position. Here, while UESF\u2019s commitment to securing\n14\n15 services for the immigrant and unhoused through an addition to the CBA identifying the District\n16\nas a Sanctuary District is an objective that the District agrees with certainly following the\n17\noutrageous attacks on the immigrant communities around the country and especially following\n18\nunfounded detention of five year old Liam Conejo Ramos and his father when he returned home\n19\nafter school. However, UESF\u2019s proposal is not a mandatory subject of bargaining and therefore\n20\n21 it is not appropriate to include in the CBA. Furthermoe, the proposal imposes onerous\n22\nresponsibilities on the District as a landlord, job trainer, and legal advocate and if adopted would\n23\nexpose the District to significant liability that would misdirect District resources away from\n24\nDistrict employees. The Panel recommends that the District and UESF memorialize their joint\n25\nsupport of a Sanctuary District that is committed to assisting families and students when\n26\n27 appropriate.\n28\nHEARING DATE: JANUARY 23, 2026 - 16",

There is no dispute, the District is still in a\n6\n7 precarious financial position and only recently reported it expects to move to a qualified financial\n8\ncertification. Even though the District is moving towards a positive certification, until that\n9\noccurs any budgetary changes must be scrutinized and approved by the State. Therefore, it is in\n10\nthe party\u2019s best interest to reach agreement on the outstanding issues with the hope that the\n11\nDistrict secures its positive financial certification by the time the next contract period rolls\n12\n13 around.\n14\nCONCLUSION\n15\n16\nGiven the record as a whole, and UESF\u2019s emphasis on securing full dependent benefits as\n17\na necessary component of any contract agreement, the Panel was limited in its ability to craft an\n18\n19 evaluation and recommendation, which could be acceptable to both sides, especially considering\n20\nthe District\u2019s financial certification.\n21\nThe Panel agrees there are significant challenges associated with Issue 4: Sanctuary and\n22\n23 Student Housing Protections. While it would be problematic for the District to adopt UESF\u2019s\n24 proposal and inappropriate on multiple levels to include the Association\u2019s proposal in CBA, the\n25\nPanel agreed that given the current challenges and threats from ICE and the fear that exists at this\n26\ntime, it is appropriate for the parties to create a resolution that expresses their joint approach to\n27\n28\nHEARING DATE: JANUARY 23, 2026 - 17",

Finally, while the Panel recognizes and\n11\nunderstands the Association\u2019s commitment to securing full dependent benefits at the kaiser rate\n12\nfor all of its members, that proposal is simply not feasible at this time given the District\u2019s\n13\nnegative/qualified financial certification. However, the Panel encourages the parties to tap into\n14\n15 the resources available in the existing parcel tax to provide this benefit to its members for at least\n16 the next three years with the possibility of an extension. If the parties are able to work together\n17\nto fund these benefits from alternative sources the District will be in a better place once it is\n18\noutside of State scrutiny to include these items in future contracts.\n19\n20 The Panel is aware UESF has secured a strike vote and intends to strike if they do not\n21\naccept the Panel\u2019s recommendation; but the Panel believes a compromise that can actually be\n22\nfulfilled financially is in the best interest of the community and will go a long way towards\n23\nsecuring a healthy labor/management relationship for future negotiations.\n24\n25\n///\n26\n///\n27\n28\nHEARING DATE: JANUARY 23, 2026 - 18",

These\nexpenditures amount to 25 percent of the District\u2019s $977.9 million general operating\nbudget for that year (in the General Fund and special revenue funds). SFUSD\u2019s\nexpenditure level of 25 percent was higher than the median 18 percent of general\noperating budget spent on Central Administration functions by twelve comparator\ndistricts. Expenditure data was obtained from the California Department of Education\nto whom all districts report their expenditures using standardized categories.\n\u25aa The 1,294.1 filled FTEs allocated to Central Administrative functions at SFUSD in FY\n2020-21 amounted to 16 percent of its 7,956 total filled FTEs. This allocation equates to\n220.4 FTEs for every 10,000 students in the District, well above the median of 138.4\nfilled FTEs for every 10,000 students for five peer districts that provided their position\nBudget and Legislative Analyst\n1",

Instructional Supervision and Administration is\none of several subfunctions of Instruction-Related Services, which is a category of\nactivities defined by the California Department of Education. (We excluded other\nInstruction-Related Services subfunctions dedicated to individual school sites such as\nInstructional Library, Media, and Technology, and School Administration [school-site\nprincipals and other site-based administrators] because we do not consider these\nfunctions to be Central Administrative functions.)\n\u25aa SFUSD was also well over median spending compared to peer districts for Board and\nSuperintendent and Centralized Data Processing expenditures.

    "4": "Report to Supervisor Ronen\nJanuary 10, 2023\n\u25aa Per student, SFUSD spent more than the comparison districts on some General\nAdministrative functions including the administrative and policy roles of the Board and\nSuperintendent and centralized data processing. The District spent slightly less on All\nOther General Administrative functions such as: finance; payroll; accounting; personnel\nand human resources; purchasing; and warehousing and distribution. It also spent less\nper student on Plant Services (physical site services including grounds, building, and\nequipment maintenance and repair, security services, and capital projects).\n\u25aa In addition to analyzing Central Administrative functions, we also evaluated SFUSD\u2019s\noverall Operating Expenditures compared to the peer districts. This analysis found that\nin addition to spending more on Central Administrative functions than peer districts,\nSFUSD spends more on non-Central Administrative functions (Instruction, some\nInstruction-Related Services, Pupil Services, Ancillary Services, and Enterprise) both\noverall and per student. Overall, SFUSD\u2019s total Operating Expenditures were 45 percent\nmore than the median of the peer comparison districts in FY 2020-21. However, the\nvariance between SFUSD and the peer districts was greater for Central Administrative\nfunctions, for which the District spent 83 percent more than the other districts, as\ncompared to the variance for non-Central Administrative functions, for which SFUSD\nspent 32 percent more than the median of the other districts.\n\u25aa This analysis also showed that the percentage variance in spending between District\nexpenditures and those of the peer districts was greater for Central Administrative\nfunctions than for non-Central Administrative functions when measured per student.\nMeasured per school site, SFUSD spent a slightly higher amount per school site on\nCentral Administrative functions but less on non-Central Administrative functions and\noverall Operating Expenditures per school site. This difference is because SFUSD has\nmore schools than the median number of schools of the peer districts and fewer\nstudents per school.\n\u25aa Staffing per student showed similar patterns as the expenditure comparisons. The\nresults of our comparative staffing analysis show that SFUSD, with 220.4 filled Central\nAdministration FTEs for every 10,000 students, has 59 percent more Central\nAdministrative staffing than the median of the five peer districts. When comparing filled\nCentral Administration FTEs as a percentage of total filled FTEs, SFUSD at 16 percent is\nequal to the peer district median of 16 percent.

For SFUSD, there are 7,956 total\nFTEs excluding vacant positions. However, analysis of the existing vacancy data leads us to believe that the\ninclusion of vacancies would have little to no effect on the conclusions in this report. For example, including\nvacancies, SFUSD\u2019s Central Administration FTEs per 10,000 pupils is still higher than the other districts\u2019 Central\nAdministration FTEs per 10,000 pupils, with or without vacancies.

For example, SFUSD has a robust\ncurriculum development function to create its own school curriculum, while the peer\ndistricts in our analysis may use pre-developed curriculum. In addition, SFUSD may\nreceive additional resources from federal, state, and local sources that allow it to\nincrease its investment in Instructional Supervision and Administration compared to the\ncomparator districts. However, even excluding restricted resources, the District\u2019s\nallocation of unrestricted general fund resources to Instructional Supervision and\nAdministration is still substantially more than the median amount allocated to this\nfunction by the comparison districts from their restricted and unrestricted funds\ncombined.

Overview of San Francisco Unified School District\nBackground\nThe San Francisco Unified School District (\u201cSFUSD\u201d or the \u201cDistrict\u201d) is the public school district in\nSan Francisco that provides public education to students in grades pre-kindergarten to 12. SFUSD\nalso administers the San Francisco County Office of Education, which is responsible for oversight\nfunctions and specific county-provided programming within SFUSD and is the chartering entity with\noversight responsibility for the City\u2019s charter schools. SFUSD is governed by a Board of Education of\nseven members who are elected at large to serve four-year terms. The Board of Education is\nresponsible for establishing educational goals and standards, approving curriculum, adopting the\nDistrict\u2019s budget, appointing District personnel, and approving purchases, contracts, capital projects,\nand other items. The Board of Education appoints a superintendent of schools to manage the day-\nto-day administration and operations of the District.\nDistrict Funding and Budgeting\nSchool districts in California receive funding from an array of state, federal, and local funding sources.\nCalifornia allocates funding for K-12 education according to the Local Control Funding Formula\n(\u201cLCFF\u201d), which distributes education funding to school districts, county offices of education, and\ncharter schools according to a complex formula that incorporates grade span, average daily\nattendance, unduplicated percentages of disadvantaged pupils, and other components. SFUSD also\nreceives revenue from federal sources (primarily Every Student Succeeds Act funding), other state\nsources (primarily the After School Education and Safety fund, lottery funding, and special education\nfunding), and local sources (described in more detail following Exhibit 1).

According to the District\u2019s FY 2020-21 Annual\nAudit Report, SFUSD received nearly $45 million of QTEA funding in FY 2020-21.\n\u2022 The Public Education and Enrichment Fund (\u201cPEEF\u201d) is a fund that was approved by San\nFrancisco voters in 2004 and re-established in 2014. The City and County of San Francisco is\nrequired to annually appropriate monies to the fund according to levels established in City\nCharter Section 16.123-2. SFUSD receives two-thirds of the annual PEEF allocation and the\nCity\u2019s Department of Early Care and Education receives the remaining one-third. SFUSD\u2019s\nPEEF funding supports sports, libraries, arts and music, and school programs including\nwellness centers, student support professionals, translation services, and peer resources.\nAccording to the District\u2019s FY 2020-21 Annual Audit Report, SFUSD received more than $71\nmillion of PEEF funding in FY 2020-21.\n\u2022 The Living Wage for Educators Act (\u201cLWEA\u201d) is a parcel tax that was passed by San Francisco\nvoters in 2018 and replaced in 2020 by the Fair Wages for Educators Act (\u201cFWEA\u201d). Both\nparcel taxes fund targeted increases to teacher salaries and professional development.\nHowever, following the passage of the Living Wage for Educators Act, a lawsuit challenging\nthe initiative was filed and funds were withheld from SFUSD pending the outcome of the\nlawsuit. SFUSD drew from its rainy day reserve funds to invest in higher teacher salaries while\nthe lawsuit was pending, and the City also provided interim funding to the District. According\nto the District\u2019s budget book, SFUSD withdrew $34 million in rainy day reserves and the City\nprovided $6 million to support higher educator salaries in FY 2020-21 in lieu of the LWEA. In\nNovember of 2021, the lawsuit challenging the LWEA failed, and SFUSD will receive this\nfunding going forward.\nSFUSD\u2019s budget is adopted annually by the Board of Education, in accordance with the provisions in\nSection 42127 of the California Education Code.\nRole of the County Office of Education\nIn California, county offices of education are responsible for the oversight and monitoring of school\ndistricts within county jurisdictions. (For example, the Alameda County Office of Education oversees\nthe 18 school districts within Alameda County, including the Oakland Unified School District, the\nBerkeley Unified School District, and the Fremont Unified School District.) County offices of education\nare typically managed by a county superintendent of schools and an elected county board of\neducation. Under California Education Code Section 1240, the county superintendent of schools\nsupervises the schools of that county, is responsible for the fiscal oversight of school districts in the\ncounty, enforces the course of study, and conducts site visits to schools. County offices of education\nare also responsible for providing direct services to students enrolled in special programs like some\nspecial education programs, community schools, and juvenile court schools.\nMost county offices of education have multiple school districts within their jurisdictions. However,\nSan Francisco County has a single district: SFUSD. As a result, SFUSD also functions as the San\nBudget and Legislative Analyst\n10",

Expenditures that are joint or shared between SFUSD and\nthe San Francisco County Office of Education are allocated proportionally between SFUSD funds and\nthe County Office of Education fund. For example, the salary and benefits costs of the SFUSD\nSuperintendent position, who serves as both the SFUSD Superintendent and the County Office of\nEducation Superintendent, are paid in part from SFUSD\u2019s General Fund (Fund 01) and in part from\nthe San Francisco County Office of Education Fund (Fund 05).\nTo identify and compare SFUSD\u2019s administrative budget and staffing levels with other districts, we\nremoved SFUSD\u2019s costs for operating the San Francisco County Office of Education because none of\nour comparison districts also operate the county office of education in their jurisdictions.2 Removing\nthe San Francisco County Office of Education Fund (Fund 05) had the effect of reducing some costs\nand positions associated with administration at SFUSD for comparison with other districts.\n2. SFUSD FY 2020-21 Expenditures\nStandardized Account Code Structure\nCalifornia Education Code Section 41010 requires that school districts in California follow the\ndefinitions, instructions, and procedures in the California School Accounting Manual (\u201cCSAM\u201d) for\nthe management of their financial resources. The manual establishes policies and procedures related\nto the basis of accounting, revenue and expenditure recognition, fund types, types of transactions,\nmethods of posting transactions, documentation required to substantiate transactions, and year-end\nclosing processes. The CSAM also establishes the chart of accounts that corresponds to an account\nstring that contains seven numerically coded fields known as the standardized account code\nstructure (\u201cSACS\u201d). For each field, the manual defines a set of accounts so that transactions can be\ngrouped according to the classification of the field. Each school district in California, including SFUSD,\nis required to adhere to the standardized structure and the definitions established in the manual.\n1 In SFUSD\u2019s Annual Audit Reports, San Francisco County Office of Education revenues and expenditures are\nrecorded under the \u201cCounty School Service Special Revenue Fund.\u201d\n2 There are six other counties in California that contain a single school district that is also the county office of\neducation: Alpine, Amador, Del Norte, Mariposa, Plumas, and Sierra.\nBudget and Legislative Analyst\n11",

To account for variation among school districts in organizational structure and naming, we\nidentified the CSAM functions most appropriate to be considered Central Administrative functions\nwhich could then be applied consistently across school districts.

Instructional Supervision and\nAdministration captures spending on activities to assist instructional staff in planning, developing,\n4 The number of school sites for each district was taken from each district\u2019s FY 2020-21 Annual Audit Report.\nHowever, some districts count school sites differently, so we made some adjustments for the data used in this\nreport to ensure consistency of our analysis. Specifically, we did not include preschools, because not all districts\nreported the number of preschools, but did include early childhood education centers (for Sacramento City\nUnified and Garden Grove Unified we excluded 42 and three preschools, respectively; for Oakland Unified and\nSFUSD we included 28 and 12 early childhood education centers, respectively).

There are optional\nbudgetary codes to further specify the type of instructional supervision and/or administrative\nactivity; however, SFUSD does not make extensive use of these optional codes, so we were unable\nto compare SFUSD\u2019s spending to the spending of other districts in more detail. The optional codes\ncapture the following activities:\n\u2022 Instructional supervision: Activities associated with directing, managing, and supervising\ninstructional services.\n\u2022 Instructional research: Activities associated with assessing programs and instructions based\non research.\n\u2022 Curriculum development: Activities that aid teachers in developing the curriculum,\npreparing and utilizing special curriculum materials, and understanding techniques to\nmotivate students.\n\u2022 In-house instructional staff development: Expenditures for staff or consultants to develop\ncurriculum for the professional or occupational growth of instructional staff members.\n\u2022 Instructional administration of special projects: Activities associated with the\nadministration of special projects, such as Title I or migrant education.\nIt is possible to compare SFUSD\u2019s spending on Instructional Supervision and Administration by type\nof expenditure (for example, salaries and benefits, supplies, and services). As shown in Exhibit 11 and\nExhibit 12 below, SFUSD spends significantly more on all types of Instructional Supervision and\nAdministration, both in total and per student, but particularly within Services and Other Operating\nExpenditures. Services and Other Operating Expenditures is defined in the CSAM as expenditures for\nservices, rentals, leases, maintenance contracts, dues, travel, insurance, utilities, and legal and other\noperating expenditures. Expenditures may be authorized by contracts, agreements, or purchase\norders. In total, SFUSD spent $33.9 million on this type of expenditure in FY 2020-21, compared to\nthe median value of the peer districts of $1.7 million.\nExhibit 11 and Exhibit 12 below also show that SFUSD spends significantly more on salaries and\nbenefits within Instructional Supervision and Administration. As discussed later in this report, SFUSD\nhas a higher number of positions in Instructional Supervision and Administration than some of the\npeer districts, which is part of the cause of SFUSD\u2019s high spending on salaries and benefits. Salary\nand benefit expenditures will also be affected by variations in employee compensation rates across\ndistricts, and we assume that SFUSD\u2019s costs are higher in this area due to high local costs of living\nand associated higher compensation rates.\nBudget and Legislative Analyst\n20",

The standardized account code structure allows us to analyze SFUSD\u2019s\nauthorized positions in several ways, as described in this section.\nIn FY 2020-21, SFUSD had 8,434.9 full-time equivalent (FTE) authorized positions and the San\nFrancisco County Office of Education had 1,191.9 FTE authorized positions for a grand total of 9,626.8\nFTEs for both organizations. These numbers reflect the fact that some positions are shared between\nSFUSD and the County Office of Education and are therefore funded partially by SFUSD and partially\nby the County Office of Education. For example, the SFUSD Superintendent position, who serves as\nboth the County Superintendent and the District Superintendent, is allocated 0.6 FTE to SFUSD and\n0.4 FTE to the County Office of Education.

Comparison District Staffing\nUtilizing the same methodology that we applied to the SFUSD position data, we defined and\nidentified the Central Administrative functions, and their corresponding FTEs, for five peer districts.\nUnlike school district budget information, detailed information on a school district\u2019s authorized\npositions is not available online, so we reached out to the 12 school districts that we identified as\nour peer comparison districts and requested their FY 2020-21 position control documents. Five of\nthe districts responded with position control data that enabled us to replicate the methodology we\nused for SFUSD and conduct an appropriate comparison. Those five districts are: Fresno Unified\nSchool District, Long Beach Unified School District, Elk Grove Unified School District, Corona-Norco\nUnified School District, and Oakland Unified School District. (See Appendix III for summary\ninformation about these five peer districts.)\nOur peer comparison methodology has a few limitations. First, three of the five peer districts were\nunable to provide position control data that includes vacant positions, so as previously stated, for\nour comparative analysis we removed vacant positions from SFUSD\u2019s position control data and from\nthe other two peer districts. However, we do not believe that this changes the conclusions of our\nanalysis in any way, and a full description of our methodology is included in Appendix II for further\ninformation. Additionally, although there is much uniformity across the five school districts\u2019 position\ncontrol documents because of the CSAM requirements, there is room for interpretation by each\ndistrict regarding the CSAM categories in which they classify their positions. Potential variations in\ninterpretation mean that some school districts may classify the same or similar positions differently,\nwhich would affect our comparative analysis. Additionally, all position control data is self-reported,\nwhich means that we do not have a way to verify that each district, including SFUSD, is coding their\npositions according to the CSAM requirements.

SFUSD has approximately 19 and 11 percent more Central\nAdministration FTEs per 10,000 students than Fresno Unified and Long Beach Unified, respectively,\nwhich are the comparison districts with the next-highest numbers of FTEs per student, and it has 59\npercent more Central Administration FTEs per 10,000 students than the median of the five peer\ncomparators. The high levels of Central Administration staffing are driven primarily by SFUSD\u2019s high\nnumber of FTEs in Instructional Supervision and Administration compared to the other districts.\nHowever, SFUSD also has a higher number of General Administration FTEs compared to the peer\ndistricts. For Plant Services, SFUSD has a lower number of Central Administration FTEs per school site\ncompared to the median for the peer districts. Regarding the ratio of supervisors to non-supervisory\nstaff, SFUSD is in the middle of its peers for Instructional Supervision and Administration and has the\nBudget and Legislative Analyst\n42",

Of the main types of Central\nAdministrative functions, SFUSD spends more in total on Instructional Supervision and\nAdministration activities than it does on General Administration activities or on Plant Services\nactivities. Within the Central Administrative functions, we found that Instructional Supervision and\nAdministration was the largest source of the difference in both staffing and expenditures, followed\nby General Administration, both proportionally and per student. Conversely, we found that SFUSD\ndoes not invest as much as its peers on Plant Services, despite having more school sites than many\nof the districts in our comparison cohort.\nIn some cases, it is clear that higher levels of investment in particular areas are the result of specific\npolicy choices on the part of the District. For example, SFUSD has a robust curriculum development\nfunction to create its own school curriculum, while the peer districts in our analysis may use pre-\ndeveloped curriculum. In addition, SFUSD may receive additional resources from federal, state, and\nlocal sources that it chooses to use to increase its investment in Instructional Supervision and\nAdministration. However, overall, the results of this analysis show that the District may wish to\nevaluate its spending and staffing levels in Instructional Supervision and Administration in particular,\ngiven how much more it resources this area than peer districts.\nPolicy Options\nThe Board of Supervisors should:\n1. Call a public hearing and present the information contained in this report to SFUSD for\nadditional discussion and analysis as part of an assessment of policy choices and funding\ndecisions, and request that SFUSD provide additional information and context as\nappropriate, in order to inform SFUSD\u2019s policy and budgetary decisions.\n2. Request that SFUSD report back to the Board of Supervisors in six months on its assessment\nof the results of this analysis and any resulting changes in resource allocations.\nBudget and Legislative Analyst\n43",

Resources within a general fund may be restricted\n(resources that have special accounting or reporting requirements, or that are legally\nrestricted to certain uses) or unrestricted.\nStudent The student activity fund is used to account separately for the operating activities of\nactivities fund associated student body accounts that are not fiduciary in nature, including student clubs,\nathletics, and other student body activities.\nSpecial revenue Special revenue funds account for the proceeds from specific revenue sources that are\nfunds restricted or committed to certain activities. SFUSD\u2019s primary special revenue funds are the\nChild Development Fund (fund 12), which accounts for federal, state, and local revenues to\noperate child development programs, and the Cafeteria Special Revenue Fund (fund 13),\nwhich accounts for federal, state, and local revenues to operate the district\u2019s food service\nprogram.\nCapital projects Capital projects funds account for financial resources used for the acquisition or\nfunds construction of major capital facilities and other capital assets. SFUSD\u2019s primary capital\nprojects funds are the Building Fund (fund 21), which accounts for proceeds from the sale of\nbonds; the Capital Facilities Fund (fund 25), which accounts for revenues received from fees\nlevied on development projects; the Special Reserve Fund for Capital Outlay Projects (fund\n40), which accumulates general fund monies for capital outlay purposes; and the Capital\nProjects Fund for Blended Component Units (fund 49), which accounts for capital projects\nfinanced by Mello-Roos Community Facilities Districts12 and similar entities.\nDebt service Debt service funds account for the accumulation of resources for and payment of principal\nfunds and interest on general long-term debt. SFUSD\u2019s only debt service fund is the Bond Interest\nand Redemption Fund (fund 51), for the repayments of bonds issued by the District.\nProprietary Proprietary funds include enterprise funds, which account for activities for which a fee is\nfunds charged to external users for goods or services (typically operated more similarly to a\nprivate business enterprise) and internal service funds, which account for services that are\nrendered to other organizational units of the district on a cost-reimbursement basis\n(designed to be self-supporting with the intent of full cost recovery). SFUSD\u2019s internal\nservice fund is its self-insurance fund, which accounts for and reports activities related to\nthe self-insured workers compensation program.\nCounty school The general fund for a county office of education is called the county school service fund. At\nservice fund SFUSD, revenues and expenditures associated with the San Francisco County Office of\nEducation are accounted for in fund 05.\nSource: California School Accounting Manual.\n12 The Mello-Roos Community Facilities Act of 1982 (Government Code Section 53311 et seq.) allows any\ncounty, city, special district, school district, or joint powers authority to establish, with voter approval, a\ncommunity facilities district for the purpose of selling tax-exempt bonds to finance public improvements and\nservices.\nBudget and Legislative Analyst\n44",

The instruction function area includes special education instruction, including\nspecial education separate classes, in-classroom special education services, and other\nspecialized services for special education.\nInstruction- Instruction-related services provide administrative, technical, and logistical support to\nrelated facilitate and enhance instruction. The main categories of instruction-related services are:\nservices instructional supervision and administration, which are activities to assist instructional staff\nin planning, developing, and evaluating instruction including curriculum development and\nstaff training; instructional library, media, and technology, which are activities concerned\nwith media and audiovisual teaching and learning resources, including printed and non-\nprinted educational materials, audiovisual hardware and content materials, and the costs of\nlibrarians, library clerks, and audiovisual personnel; and school administration, which are\nactivities to manage and direct the operation of a particular school, including the functions\nof the principal, assistant principals, and clerical staff who work in support of school-based\nadministrative duties.\nPupil services Pupil services are support services provided directly to students that are not instructional\nservices. Pupil services include: guidance and counseling; psychological services; attendance\nand social work services; health services; speech pathology and audiology services; pupil\ntesting services; pupil transportation; and food services.\nAncillary Ancillary services are school-sponsored activities during the day that are not instructional,\nservices instruction-related, or pupil services. Ancillary services may include school-sponsored co-\ncurricular activities like band, choir, speech, and debate, as well as school-sponsored\nathletics and physical education.\nCommunity The community services function captures activities concerned with providing community\nservices services to community participants other than students (for example, the operation of a\ncommunity swimming pool, a recreation program for the elderly, or a community childcare\ncenter).\nEnterprise Enterprise activities are financed and operated similar to private business enterprises, with\nthe intention that costs are financed or recovered primarily through user charges. At SFUSD,\nenterprise expenditures are associated with its self-insurance fund, which accounts for\nactivities related to the District\u2019s self-insured workers compensation program.\nGeneral General administration refers to agency-wide administrative activities, including: the\nadministration administrative and policy roles of the Board and Superintendent; staff relations and\nnegotiations; public information; financial auditing; budgeting; accounts payable and\nreceivable; payroll; accounting; personnel and human resources; staff development;\nplanning, research, and development; purchasing; warehousing and distribution; printing,\npublishing, and duplicating; and data processing, computer facility management, and\nsystems development.\nPlant services Plant services include plant maintenance and operations, which capture activities that keep\na district\u2019s physical locations open, comfortable, and safe for use, and keeping the grounds,\nbuildings, and equipment in working condition and satisfactory repair; facilities acquisition\nand construction, which are activities concerned with capital projects such as acquiring land\nand buildings, remodeling or constructing buildings, and improving sites; and facilities rents\nand leases, which are activities to acquire facilities through operating leases or rentals.\nOther outgo Other outgo records debt service payments, transfers between the district and another\nagency, and interfund transfers, which are transfers between different funds of the district.\nSource: California School Accounting Manual.\nBudget and Legislative Analyst\n45",
    "46": "Report to Supervisor Ronen\nJanuary 10, 2023\nAppendix II: Defining and Calculating Central Administration Functions\nTo define \u201cCentral Administration\u201d functions, we relied on the California School Accounting Manual\u2019s\ncategorization of function codes. We chose this method because the CSAM allows our methodology\nto be replicated for each comparison school district, since each school district follows the uniform\nCSAM accounting procedures.\nFor this analysis, we define Central Administration as any authorized position that is coded under the\nfunction groups Instructional Supervision and Administration, General Administration, or Plant\nServices.\nGeneral Administration and Plant Services are both functions that are straightforward to classify as\nCentral Administrative. These include the functions of district-wide fiscal/budget, human resources,\nsecurity, maintenance, research and development, policy and communications, and custodial\nservices as well as the Superintendent\u2019s office and the Board of Education.\nInstructional Supervision and Administration is a sub-category of Instruction-Related Services.\nInstruction-Related Services includes functions of instructional supervision and administration,\ninstructional library, media, and technology, and school administration, which includes school-site\nprincipals and other administrators. Based on the definitions in the CSAM, we concluded that some\nof the Instruction-Related Services functions are district-wide while others are more specific to\nschool sites. The definitions of each function within the Instruction-Related Services group are:\n\u2022 Instructional Supervision and Administration: activities primarily for assisting instructional\nstaff in planning, developing, and evaluating the process of providing learning experiences\nfor students, including curriculum development and staff training on techniques of\ninstruction and awareness of how children develop and learn, and the instructional\nadministration of special projects.\n\u2022 Administrative Unit of a Multidistrict Special Education Local Plan Area (\u201cSELPA\u201d): activities\nconcerned with the receipt and distribution of regionalized services funds, provision of\nadministrative support, and coordination of the implementation of the local plan.\n\u2022 Instructional Library, Media, and Technology: activities concerned with the use of all\nteaching and learning resources, including hardware and content materials, methods, or\nexperiences used for teaching and learning, including librarians, library clerks, and\naudiovisual personnel.\n\u2022 School Administration: activities concerned with directing and managing the operation of a\nparticular school, including the principal, assistant principals, and other assistants, and\nclerical staff.\n\u2022 Other instructional resources, such as parent participation.\nBudget and Legislative Analyst\n46",
    "47": "Report to Supervisor Ronen\nJanuary 10, 2023\nBased on these definitions, we determined that only Instructional Supervision and Administration\nand Administrative Unit of a Multidistrict SELPA would be considered Central Administration. (SFUSD\ndoes not have any activities coded as \u201cAdministrative Unit of a Multidistrict SELPA,\u201d although some\nof our peer comparison districts did.) The other three are function codes for positions based primarily\nat school sites and are concerned with the activities at those specific school sites and are not district-\nwide. Therefore, within the Instruction-Related Services function group, we narrowed down the\nfunctions to only Instructional Supervision and Administration, and Administrative Unit of a\nMultidistrict SELPA.\nOur choice of methodology produced a relatively broad definition of Central Administration that was\nreplicable across peer jurisdictions but came with a trade-off of precision. We aimed to create a\ndefinition of Central Administration that only included functions and positions based in a school\ndistrict\u2019s central office, that performed district-wide work, and/or did not involve any in-class\ninstruction. However, it is possible that some school-based functions are captured within this\ndefinition of Central Administration, due to how SFUSD and/or the peer districts categorize\nexpenditures and positions. For example, the FTEs that we define as SFUSD\u2019s Central Administration\ncapture the majority of positions dedicated to district-wide work, but also include some positions\nthat are school site-based or not otherwise district-wide despite their categorization in one of the\nthree administrative-focused function groups that we define as Central Administration. These\npositions are primarily family liaisons at school sites who are coded as the Instructional Supervision\nand Administration function. However, if we excluded this function from our analysis, then we would\nalso be excluding a lot of functions that do meet our definition of Central Administration, including\nthe entire Curriculum and Instruction department. Because the goal of this analysis is to provide an\noverview of SFUSD\u2019s administrative staffing levels, and compare those levels to peer districts, we\ndetermined that a broader definition would be better for our purposes.\nLastly, we removed vacant positions from SFUSD\u2019s data and the data from our five peer districts\nbecause not all our peer districts could provide their vacant positions in their data, and we\ndetermined that it was more important to include all five peer districts than to analyze the data\nincluding vacancies. However, we do not believe that including vacancies would change the\nconclusions of our analysis. When we compared SFUSD\u2019s FTEs to the two districts that were able to\nprovide vacant positions in their data (both Fresno Unified and Elk Grove Unified provided vacant\npositions), SFUSD had the highest number of Central Administration FTEs per 10,000 students \u2013\nincluding vacancies. In fact, even removing SFUSD\u2019s vacant positions but keeping the vacant positions\nfor Fresno Unified and Elk Grove Unified did not make a difference \u2013 SFUSD still had more Central\nAdministration FTEs per 10,000 students without vacancies than the other two districts had with\nvacancies.\nBudget and Legislative Analyst\n47",

SFUSD also administers the San Francisco\nCounty Office of Education, which is responsible for oversight functions and specific county-provided\nprogramming within SFUSD and is the chartering entity with oversight responsibility for the City\u2019s\ncharter schools. SFUSD is governed by a Board of Education of seven members who are elected at\nlarge to serve four-year terms. The Board of Education is responsible for establishing educational\ngoals and standards, approving curriculum, adopting the District\u2019s budget, appointing District\npersonnel, and approving purchases, contracts, capital projects, and other items. The Board of\nEducation appoints a superintendent of schools to manage the day-to-day administration and\noperations of the District.\nDistrict Funding, Budgeting, and Accounting\nSchool districts in California receive funding from an array of state, federal, and local funding sources.\nCalifornia allocates funding for K-12 education according to the Local Control Funding Formula, which\ndistributes education funding to school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools\naccording to a complex formula that incorporates grade span, average daily attendance,\nunduplicated percentages of disadvantaged pupils, and other components. SFUSD also receives\nrevenue from federal sources (primarily Every Student Succeeds Act funding), other state sources\n(primarily the After School Education and Safety fund, lottery funding, and special education\nfunding), and local sources. SFUSD\u2019s budget is adopted annually by the Board of Education, in\naccordance with the provisions in Section 42127 of the California Education Code.\nCalifornia Education Code Section 41010 requires that school districts in California follow the\ndefinitions, instructions, and procedures in the California School Accounting Manual (\u201cCSAM\u201d) for\nthe management of their financial resources. The manual establishes policies and procedures related\nto the basis of accounting, revenue and expenditure recognition, fund types, types of transactions,\nmethods of posting transactions, documentation required to substantiate transactions, and year-end\nclosing processes. The CSAM also establishes the chart of accounts that corresponds to an account\nstring that contains seven numerically coded fields known as the standardized account code\nstructure (\u201cSACS\u201d). For each field, the manual defines a set of accounts so that transactions can be\ngrouped according to the classification of the field. Each school district in California, including SFUSD,\nis required to adhere to the standardized structure and the definitions established in the manual.\nBudget and Legislative Analyst\n6",

A fund is a fiscal and accounting entity with\na self-balancing set of accounts that record cash and other financial resources and\nrelated liabilities. Examples include the general fund, child development fund, and\ncafeteria special revenue fund.\nFunction The function field identifies the activities or services performed or describes the activity\n(Activity) for which a service or material is acquired. Examples include instruction, school\nadministration, pupil transportation, and general administration.\nObject The object field classifies expenditures by type of commodity or service. Examples\ninclude salaries, employee benefits, or books and supplies.\nSource: California School Accounting Manual\nRole of the County Office of Education\nIn California, county offices of education are responsible for the oversight and monitoring of school\ndistricts within county jurisdictions. (For example, the Alameda County Office of Education oversees\nthe 18 school districts within Alameda County, including the Oakland Unified School District, the\nBerkeley Unified School District, and the Fremont Unified School District.) County offices of education\nare typically managed by a county superintendent of schools and an elected county board of\neducation. Under California Education Code Section 1240, the county superintendent of schools\nsupervises the schools of that county, is responsible for the fiscal oversight of school districts in the\ncounty, enforces the course of study, and conducts site visits to schools. County offices of education\nare also responsible for providing direct services to students enrolled in special programs like some\nspecial education programs, community schools, and juvenile court schools.\nMost county offices of education have multiple school districts within their jurisdictions. However,\nSan Francisco County has a single district: SFUSD. As a result, SFUSD also functions as the San\nFrancisco County Office of Education, the SFUSD Board of Education functions as the County Board\nof Education, and the SFUSD Superintendent functions as the County Superintendent of Schools.\nFor financial reporting and control purposes, SFUSD maintains a separate budget for the San\nFrancisco County Office of Education in a single, separate fund (Fund 05). Fund 05 records County\nOffice of Education revenues (including Local Control Funding Formula revenue from the state) and\nCounty Office of Education expenditures. Expenditures that are joint or shared between SFUSD and\nthe San Francisco County Office of Education are allocated proportionally between SFUSD funds and\nthe County Office of Education Fund.

To do this comparison, we defined \u201ccentral\nadministrative functions\u201d according to the chart of accounts established in the California School\nAccounting Manual to allow for consistent comparisons to other school districts. Because all school\ndistricts in California must report their expenditures to the California Department of Education using\nthe standardized account code structure, this analytical approach allowed us to collect and compare\nexpenditure and staffing data for SFUSD and our comparison districts by fund, function, and object\nconsistently.\nFor consistency, this analysis continues to use the same definition of central administrative\nfunctions as our prior January 2023 report, with one notable difference. This analysis, which is\nlimited to SFUSD, includes the San Francisco County Office of Education Fund (Fund 05) in the\ndefinition of SFUDS\u2019s operating budget and central administrative functions, in order to provide the\nmost accurate view of SFUSD operational spending. Therefore, the amounts reported in this\nanalysis will vary from the amounts reported in our January 2023 report, which excluded the County\nOffice of Education Fund (Fund 05) from SFUSD\u2019s operating expenditures in order to ensure\nconsistency with other school districts.\nThe functions and funds we determined to include in our analysis are summarized in Exhibit 2 below.\nAppendix II contains a more in-depth discussion of the methodology we used to define central\nadministrative functions.\nBudget and Legislative Analyst\n8",

As noted above, it was not\npossible using SFUSD\u2019s budget summary detail reports to identify the exact amount of reclassified\ncompared to reduced expenditures that would allow us to identify which budget decreases\nrepresented a material decrease in spending and which budget decreases were simply due to the\nexpenditure being moved elsewhere in the budget. For more information and explanation, we\nsubmitted follow-up questions to SFUSD staff about the nature of the significant areas of change we\nidentified in our analysis. The District\u2019s responses are provided below in this report.\n\u2022 Instructional Supervision and Administration decreased by $35.3 million, or 27 percent,\nbetween FY 2020-21 and FY 2022-23. Instructional Supervision and Administration captures\nactivities for assisting instructional staff in planning, developing, and evaluating instruction,\nBudget and Legislative Analyst\n12",
    "13": "Report to Supervisor Ronen\nJune 13, 2023\nincluding curriculum development and staff training on techniques of instruction, as well as\ninstructional administration of special projects. This function had the second largest\ndecrease in District budgeted expenditures between FY 2020-21 and 2022-23, behind\nTransfers, which decreased by $56.6 million during the review years. According to SFUSD,\nthe primary drivers of this reduction were (1) reductions to the Curriculum and Instruction\nand Student and Family Services budgets, and (2) the reclassification of expenditures to\nInstruction, Pupil Services, and Personnel/Human Resources to better align with California\u2019s\nstandardized accounting structure for K-12 education.\n\u2022 Centralized Data Processing increased by $13.0 million, or 28 percent, between FY 2020-21\nand FY 2022-23. Centralized Data Processing accounts for the costs of District-wide\nadministrative data processing services, including computer facility management, computer\nprocessing, systems development, and other related data functions, for applications that\nsupport attendance accounting, grade reporting, financial accounting, and other data\nprocessing needs. According to SFUSD, the primary drivers of this increase were increased\nexpenditures related to operations of EMPowerSF, the new employee information and\npayroll system launched in January 2022.\n\u2022 Facilities Acquisition and Construction, which increased by $5.7 million, or 33 percent,\nbetween FY 2020-21 and FY 2022-23. Facilities Acquisition and Construction captures costs\nrelated to capital projects, such as acquiring land and buildings, remodeling buildings,\nconstructing buildings and additions to buildings, initially installing or extending service\nsystems and other built-in equipment, and improving sites. According to SFUSD, the primary\ndriver of this increase was increased rates for the provision of standard services.\n\u2022 Personnel/Human Resources Services, which increased by $5.2 million, or 56 percent,\nbetween FY 2020-21 and FY 2022-23. Personnel/Human Resources Services includes\nactivities such as staff development, recruitment and placement, staff transfers, health\nservices, and staff accounting, including legal costs directly identifiable with\npersonnel/human resources activities. According to SFUSD, the primary drivers of this\nincrease were expenditures related to the operations of EMPowerSF and the reclassification\nof expenditures from Instructional Supervision and Administration to better align with\nCalifornia\u2019s standardized accounting structure for K-12 education.\nThe largest (over $5 million) areas of budget changes for non-central administrative functions in\nSFUSD\u2019s operating funds were as follows.\n\u2022 Instruction increased by $144.7 million, or 25 percent, between FY 2020-21 and FY 2022-23.\nInstruction spending captures all instructional interactions between teachers and students,\nincluding special education, as well as the activities of aides and classroom assistance. This\nincrease represents the single largest increase in budgeted expenditures between FY 2020-\n21 and 2022-23 in the District. According to SFUSD, the primary driver of this increase was\nBudget and Legislative Analyst\n13",

Transfers, which are considered\nOther Outgo rather than Expenditures in the California School Accounting Manual, are\nmovements of resources between agencies (including outgoing tuitions and transfers of\napportionments and resources) and between funds (not classified as quasi-external\ntransactions, reimbursements, interfund loans or borrowing, or advances). According to\nSFUSD, the primary driver of this decrease is a change in the District\u2019s approach to budgeting\nfor Special Education. Special Education costs used to be budgeted in the County Office of\nEducation Fund, which required an interfund transfer from District funds to the County Office\nof Education Fund. Because the revenue for Special Education is first received by the District,\nSpecial Education costs have now been shifted to District funds to more accurately reflect\nboth the receipt of funds and the services budgeted.\n\u2022 Pupil Services increased by $39.2 million, or 25 percent, between FY 2020-21 and FY 2022-\n23. Pupil Services captures spending on non-instructional services for pupils, including\nguidance and counseling, psychological services, attendance and social work services, health\nservices, speech pathology and audiology services, testing services, transportation services,\nand food services. According to SFUSD, the primary driver of this increase was the\nreclassification of expenditures to more accurately reflect the services provided.\n\u2022 School Administration increased by $13.8 million, or 26 percent, between FY 2020-21 and FY\n2022-23. School Administration captures activities related to directing and managing the\noperations of a particular school site, including the activities of the principal, assistant\nprincipals, and clerical staff who provide and/or support school operations, the evaluation\nand support of teaching and administrative duties, and coordination of instructional\nactivities. According to SFUSD, the primary driver of this increase was a savings offset applied\nto School Administrator salaries in FY 2020-21 that was removed in subsequent years.\nExhibit 5 below summarizes SFUSD\u2019s budgeted operating expenditures on central administrative\nfunctions by fund.\nBudget and Legislative Analyst\n14",

However, by fund, the largest dollar value changes between FY 2020-21\nand FY 2022-23 occurred in the County Office of Education Fund, which was reduced by $10.1 million\nor 54 percent between FY 2020-21 and FY 2022-23, and the Deferred Maintenance Fund, which\nincreased by $9.6 million or 281 percent between FY 2020-21 and FY 2022-23. According to SFUSD,\nthe primary drivers of these decreases were a technical change to the Special Education budget, an\nincrease in the cost of facilities maintenance, and increased facilities enhancements expenditures to\nensure that facilities are safe for students after COVID-19. Notably, the amounts budgeted for\nInstructional Supervision and Administration in both the General Fund and the County Office of\nEducation Fund decreased significantly, by $15.5 and $16.3 million respectively, between FY 2020-\n21 and FY 2022-23.

According to\nSFUSD, the primary drivers of this decrease were reductions to the budget as part of the FY 2022-23\nBudget Balancing Plan. An additional $1.4 million reduction occurred in Certificated Personnel\nSalaries, which are salaries for credentialed or permitted staff. These reductions are partially offset\nby increases in the budgets for Capital Outlay ($3.3 million) and Classified Personnel Salaries ($1.1\nmillion).\nOf the $142.8 million increase in the operating budget for non-central administrative functions, the\nlargest area of increase was in Employee Benefits ($79.0 million), followed by Services and Other\nOperating Expenditures ($50.6 million), and Certificated and Classified Personnel Salaries ($32.3 and\n$30.8 million, respectively).

While the decrease in salaries and benefits expenditures shown in Exhibit 7 implies\nthat a reduction in personnel assigned to this function occurred over the period reviewed, the\nreduction in Services and Other Operating Expenditures is responsible for reduction in budgeted\nexpenditures to a much greater degree.\nSummary and Conclusion\nOverall, SFUSD\u2019s total operating budget in the General Fund, County Office of Education Fund, and\nspecial revenue funds grew by $133.6 million, or 11 percent, from FY 2020-21 to FY 2022-23.\nBudgeted expenditures on central administrative functions decreased by $9.2 million, or by three\npercent, during the time period, and budgeted expenditures on non-central administrative functions\nincreased by $142.8 million, or by 16 percent.\nThe $9.2 million decrease in the budget for central administrative functions occurred primarily in\nInstructional Supervision and Administration, which decreased by $35.3 million between FY 2020-21\nand FY 2022-23 (this decrease was offset by increases in other areas), primarily in SFUSD\u2019s General\nFund and the County Office of Education Fund. Both within central administrative functions overall\nand within Instructional Supervision and Administration specifically, the largest category of\nreductions in SFUSD\u2019s operating budget was in Services and Other Operating Expenditures. Some of\nthese reductions are due to the reclassification of certain expenses previously classified as central\nadministrative functions, as discussed below.\nAccording to SFUSD staff and as noted in this report, during FY 2021-22 and FY 2022-23, the District\nreclassified some budgeted expenditures to more appropriately reflect the type, nature, and/or fund\nof the expenditure. For example, in FY 2021-22 and FY 2022-23, SFUSD re-distributed Special\nEducation expenditures between the General Fund and the County Office of Education Fund, which\nhad the effect of increasing and/or decreasing the budgets of these funds without representing a\nmeaningful change in expenditures overall. Similarly, SFUSD reclassified some services and positions\nthat had previously been classified as Instructional Supervision and Administration to different, more\nappropriate areas such as Instruction, Pupil Services, or Personnel/Human Resources. While these\nadjustments make SFUSD\u2019s budget more accurate, it also makes year-over-year budgetary\ncomparisons highly variable, as shown in the summary exhibits presented in this report. As noted in\nthe text of this report, some of the larger and more significant changes observed between FY 2020-\n21 and FY 2022-23 are due in part to budgetary reclassification, rather than actual material\nreductions in budgeted amounts for particular line items.

Resources within a general fund may be restricted\n(resources that have special accounting or reporting requirements, or that are legally\nrestricted to certain uses) or unrestricted.\nSpecial revenue Special revenue funds account for the proceeds from specific revenue sources that are\nfunds restricted or committed to certain activities. SFUSD\u2019s primary special revenue funds are the\nChild Development Fund (fund 12), which accounts for federal, state, and local revenues to\noperate child development programs, and the Cafeteria Special Revenue Fund (fund 13),\nwhich accounts for federal, state, and local revenues to operate the district\u2019s food service\nprogram.\nCapital projects Capital projects funds account for financial resources used for the acquisition or\nfunds construction of major capital facilities and other capital assets. SFUSD\u2019s primary capital\nprojects funds are the Building Fund (fund 21), which accounts for proceeds from the sale of\nbonds; the Capital Facilities Fund (fund 25), which accounts for revenues received from fees\nlevied on development projects; the Special Reserve Fund for Capital Outlay Projects (fund\n40), which accumulates general fund monies for capital outlay purposes; and the Capital\nProjects Fund for Blended Component Units (fund 49), which accounts for capital projects\nfinanced by Mello-Roos Community Facilities Districts1 and similar entities.\nDebt service Debt service funds account for the accumulation of resources for and payment of principal\nfunds and interest on general long-term debt. SFUSD\u2019s only debt service fund is the Bond Interest\nand Redemption Fund (fund 51), for the repayments of bonds issued by the District.\nProprietary Proprietary funds include enterprise funds, which account for activities for which a fee is\nfunds charged to external users for goods or services (typically operated more similarly to a\nprivate business enterprise) and internal service funds, which account for services that are\nrendered to other organizational units of the district on a cost-reimbursement basis\n(designed to be self-supporting with the intent of full cost recovery). SFUSD\u2019s internal\nservice fund is its self-insurance fund, which accounts for and reports activities related to\nthe self-insured workers compensation program.\nCounty school The general fund for a county office of education is called the county school service fund.

The main categories of instruction-related services are:\nservices instructional supervision and administration, which are activities to assist instructional staff\nin planning, developing, and evaluating instruction including curriculum development and\nstaff training; instructional library, media, and technology, which are activities concerned\nwith media and audiovisual teaching and learning resources, including printed and non-\nprinted educational materials, audiovisual hardware and content materials, and the costs of\nlibrarians, library clerks, and audiovisual personnel; and school administration, which are\nactivities to manage and direct the operation of a particular school, including the functions\nof the principal, assistant principals, and clerical staff who work in support of school-based\nadministrative duties.\nPupil services Pupil services are support services provided directly to students that are not instructional\nservices. Pupil services include: guidance and counseling; psychological services; attendance\nand social work services; health services; speech pathology and audiology services; pupil\ntesting services; pupil transportation; and food services.\nAncillary Ancillary services are school-sponsored activities during the day that are not instructional,\nservices instruction-related, or pupil services. Ancillary services may include school-sponsored co-\ncurricular activities like band, choir, speech, and debate, as well as school-sponsored\nathletics and physical education.\nCommunity The community services function captures activities concerned with providing community\nservices services to community participants other than students (for example, the operation of a\ncommunity swimming pool, a recreation program for the elderly, or a community childcare\ncenter).\nEnterprise Enterprise activities are financed and operated similar to private business enterprises, with\nthe intention that costs are financed or recovered primarily through user charges.

We chose this method in our January 2023 report2 because the\nCSAM allows our methodology to be replicated for each comparison school district, since each school\ndistrict follows the uniform CSAM accounting procedures.\nFor this analysis, we define Central Administration as any authorized position that is coded under the\nfunction groups Instructional Supervision and Administration, General Administration, or Plant\nServices.\nGeneral Administration and Plant Services are both functions that are straightforward to classify as\nCentral Administrative. These include the functions of district-wide fiscal/budget, human resources,\nsecurity, maintenance, research and development, policy and communications, and custodial\nservices as well as the Superintendent\u2019s office and the Board of Education.\nInstructional Supervision and Administration is a sub-category of Instruction-Related Services.\nInstruction-Related Services includes functions of instructional supervision and administration,\ninstructional library, media, and technology, and school administration, which includes school-site\nprincipals and other administrators. Based on the definitions in the CSAM, we concluded that some\nof the Instruction-Related Services functions are district-wide while others are more specific to\nschool sites. The definitions of each function within the Instruction-Related Services group are:\n\u2022 Instructional Supervision and Administration: activities primarily for assisting instructional\nstaff in planning, developing, and evaluating the process of providing learning experiences\nfor students, including curriculum development and staff training on techniques of\ninstruction and awareness of how children develop and learn, and the instructional\nadministration of special projects.\n\u2022 Administrative Unit of a Multidistrict Special Education Local Plan Area (\u201cSELPA\u201d): activities\nconcerned with the receipt and distribution of regionalized services funds, provision of\nadministrative support, and coordination of the implementation of the local plan.\n\u2022 Instructional Library, Media, and Technology: activities concerned with the use of all\nteaching and learning resources, including hardware and content materials, methods, or\nexperiences used for teaching and learning, including librarians, library clerks, and\naudiovisual personnel.\n2 San Francisco Unified School District Central Administrative Expenditures and Staffing Analysis, Report to\nSupervisor Hillary Ronen, Budget and Legislative Analyst.

    "6": "Fiscal Health Risk Analysis\nIntroduction\nBackground\nHistorically, FCMAT has not engaged directly with school districts showing distress until it has been invited to do so by the district\nor the county superintendent. The state\u2019s 2018-19 Budget Act provides for FCMAT to offer more proactive and preventive services\nto fiscally distressed school districts by automatically engaging with a district under the following conditions:\n\u2022 Disapproved budget\n\u2022 Negative interim report certification\n\u2022 Three consecutive qualified interim report certifications\n\u2022 Downgrade of an interim certification by the county superintendent\n\u2022 \u201cLack of going concern\u201d designation\nUnder these conditions, FCMAT will perform a fiscal health risk analysis to determine the level of risk for insolvency. FCMAT\nhas updated its Fiscal Health Risk Analysis (FHRA) tool that weights each question based on high, moderate and low risk. The\nanalysis will not be performed more than once in a 12-month period per district, and the engagement will be coordinated with the\ncounty superintendent and build on their oversight process and activities already in place per Assembly Bill (AB) 1200. There is no\ncost to the county superintendent or to the district for the analysis.\nThis fiscal health risk analysis is being conducted because the district had the following condition, under which an analysis is\nrequired by the 2018-19 State Budget Act.\n\u2022 \u201cLack of going concern\u201d designation\nThe San Francisco Unified School District is the sixth largest school district in the state. The district serves approximately 59,000\nstudents in grades K-12 and employs nearly 10,000 staff. The district serves both the city and county of San Francisco. As a\nsingle-district county, the district and the San Francisco County Office of Education are administered jointly and are governed by\nthe same board of trustees. Because of this, the state superintendent of public instruction (SPI) serves as their oversight agency.\nThe California Department of Education (CDE), on behalf of the SPI, examined the county office\u2019s and the district\u2019s 2021-22\nbudgets and approved them. However, the CDE identified concerns about the district\u2019s deficit spending and its fiscal projections\nthat indicate insufficient reserves beginning in 2022-23. As a result, the SPI determined that the district is no longer a going\nconcern, and FCMAT\u2019s engagement was triggered.\nFCMAT performed a fiscal health risk analysis to determine the district\u2019s level of risk for insolvency.\nFiscal Health Risk Analysis Guidelines\nFCMAT entered into a study agreement with the San Francisco Unified School District on October 5, 2021, and a study team\nconducted virtual interviews at various times from October 27 through December 15, 2021. Following fieldwork, the study team\ncontinued to review and analyze documents. Document collection continued through January 14, 2022. This report is the result\nof those activities.\nFCMAT\u2019s reports focus on systems and processes that may need improvement. Those that may be functioning well are generally\nnot commented on in FCMAT\u2019s reports. In writing its reports, FCMAT uses the Associated Press Stylebook, a comprehensive\nguide to usage and accepted style that emphasizes conciseness and clarity. In addition, this guide emphasizes plain language,\ndiscourages the use of jargon and capitalizes relatively few terms.\nStudy Team\nThe team was composed of the following members:\nJohn Von Flue Carolynne Beno, Ed.D.\nChief Analyst Intervention Specialist\nErin Lillibridge, CFE John Lotze\nIntervention Specialist Technical Writer\nEach team member reviewed the draft report to confirm its accuracy and to achieve consensus on the analysis.\nFiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team San Francisco Unified School District 5",
    "7": "Fiscal Health Risk Analysis\nFiscal Health Risk Analysis\nFor K-12 School Districts\nDates of fieldwork: October 27-29, November 10, and December 15, 2021\nDistrict: San Francisco Unified School District\nSummary\nIn concurrence with the concerns cited by the state superintendent of public instruction (SPI) leading to the lack of going concern\ndesignation, FCMAT\u2019s Fiscal Health Risk Analysis identifies issues that include deficit spending; issues with budget development,\nmonitoring and updating; and concerns about the district\u2019s ability to maintain sufficient reserves.\nThe SPI\u2019s oversight letters since 2019-20 have cautioned the district and the county office of education about deficit spending\nand highlighted the need to identify and implement expenditure reductions to balance their budgets, eliminate deficit spending\nand maintain ongoing fiscal solvency.\nThis analysis identifies budget monitoring as the area of most concern. FCMAT found that the district\u2019s actual revenues and\nexpenses did not align with its interim financial reports. The district should update its budget at least at each reporting period and\narticulate the budget revisions or, at minimum, clearly explain why variances exist. This has not been the case for the first interim\nreport for 2021-22 or the interim reports for 2020-21. Failure to update the budget and clearly explain any known variances can\ngive an inaccurate picture of the district\u2019s finances and fiscal status.\nThe closely aligned areas of budget development and cash management also had significant risk factors. FCMAT found that the\ndistrict does not use position control as a basis for budget development and site allocations. Because employee compensation\naccounts for a significant majority of the district\u2019s expenditures, failure to use accurate employee costs in planning can quickly\nlead to budget imbalances. FCMAT also found that the district uses contra account entries to balance the total employee\ncompensation costs. In addition, the district forecasts its cash needs only for the current year rather than for the recommended\ncurrent and subsequent year. This can create an unforeseen lack of available cash in the future because the district currently\nsupports its cash balances in several funds, including the general fund, through interfund and external borrowing.\nAs mentioned, employee compensation makes up most of the district\u2019s expenses. For 2021-22, the district\u2019s costs for salaries\nand benefits made up 93.9% of its budgeted expenditures; the latest statewide average for this number was 88%. In addition,\nat the time of this review, the district had not yet settled with all employee collective bargaining units. The district\u2019s generous\ncompensation and benefits are also evident in its current year post-employment benefits, which cost nearly $37 million, or more\nthan 6% of current year revenues, and which are projected to increase by approximately $2 million annually through 2028.\nOf further concern is the district\u2019s practice of approving compensation increases before confirming sufficient funding for the\nincrease. Compensation increases were given based on the successful passage of Proposition G, yet the funds were under legal\nchallenge and were not distributed to the district as expected.\nAt budget adoption, the district planned to use one-time funds to temporarily close a significant current year budget shortfall\nof more than $100 million. For 2022-23, the district\u2019s projection shows its reserve decreasing to $21 million, or 2.19% of its\nunrestricted general fund budget, under the assumption it can reduce its unrestricted expenditures by $97.9 million. For 2023-24,\nthe district forecasts a $21.3 million, 2%, reserve based on additional unrestricted expenditure reductions totaling $112.2 million;\nhowever, details of these expenditure reductions were not known at budget adoption.\nUltimately, the governing board is responsible for the district \u2018s budget. Management has the responsibility to maintain the\nintegrity of the district\u2019s systems, to secure the district\u2019s assets, and to present sound financial information based on current and\naccurate data so the board can make informed decisions and maintain the district\u2019s solvency.\nDistrict Fiscal Solvency Risk Level: High\nAbout the Analysis\nThe Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team (FCMAT) has developed the Fiscal Health Risk Analysis (FHRA) as a tool to\nhelp evaluate a school district\u2019s fiscal health and risk of insolvency in the current and two subsequent fiscal years.\nThe FHRA includes 20 sections, each of which contains specific questions. Each section and specific question is included\nbased on FCMAT\u2019s work since the inception of AB 1200; they are the common indicators of risk or potential insolvency for\ndistricts that have neared insolvency and needed assistance from outside agencies. Each section of this analysis is critical, and\nFiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team San Francisco Unified School District 6",
    "8": "Fiscal Health Risk Analysis\nlack of attention to these critical areas will eventually lead to a district\u2019s failure. The analysis focuses on essential functions and\nprocesses to determine the level of risk at the time of assessment.\nIn this FHRA, because San Francisco is a single-district county in which the district and the county office of education are\noverseen by the SPI, questions that refer to the county office of education in an oversight role should be interpreted to mean the\nSPI.\nThe greater the number of \u201cno\u201d answers to the questions in the analysis, the greater the potential risk of insolvency or fiscal\nissues for the district. Not all sections in the analysis and not all questions within each section carry equal weight; some areas\ncarry higher risk and thus count more heavily in calculating a district\u2019s fiscal stability. To help the district, narratives are included\nfor responses that are marked as a \u201cno\u201d so the district can better understand the reason for the response and actions that may be\nneeded to obtain a \u201cyes\u201d answer.\nIdentifying issues early is the key to maintaining fiscal health. Diligent planning will enable a district to better understand its\nfinancial objectives and strategies to sustain a high level of fiscal efficiency and overall solvency.

Consequently, the ADA projections for 2021-22, 2022-23 and 2023-24\nincluded a 97% capture rate of enrollment, which is higher than the district\u2019s historical\nattendance trends.\nThe district assumed its 2020-21 enrollment total continued into the subsequent years.\nUsing the district's enrollment estimate and adjusting down to a 95% attendance\ncapture rate would reduce the LCFF revenue total by approximately $6 million in both\n2022-23 and 2023-24 compared to the district's 2021-22 budget amounts.\nIn addition, the district did not use the most current information available to develop\nits 2021-22 LCFF revenue calculations. Specifically, the district used the unduplicated\ncount of 29,123 from the 2020-21 first apportionment rather than the count of 29,756\nfrom its February 2021 CALPADS certified total.

Because\nof this, the state superintendent of public instruction (SPI) is legally responsible to\noversee the fiscal solvency of both the district and the county office. Because both\nagencies operate as one organization, the SPI\u2019s oversight letters make no distinction\nbetween the solvency of the two agencies. For financial reporting purposes, the San\nFrancisco County Office of Education\u2019s budget is tracked separately from that of the\nschool district in the County School Service Fund.\nThe SPI\u2019s oversight letters since 2019-20 have cautioned the district and the county\noffice about deficit spending and requested that it identify and implement timely\nbudget solutions to maintain fiscal solvency.\nMost recently, on September 15, 2021, the SPI approved the 2021-22 budget but\ndetermined the district may be unable to meet its financial obligations for the current\nor two subsequent fiscal years, and therefore also determined that it is no longer a\ngoing concern. The reason for the SPI's lack of going concern determination was\nthe district's continuing projected deficit spending in the unrestricted general fund,\nwhich totaled $116.2 million in 2022-23, resulting in a projected negative unrestricted\nfund balance of $76.0 million. After a year of discussion, the district had not identified\nbudget balancing solutions and did not submit a fiscal solvency plan as the CDE had\nrequested for the 2020-21 budget and interim reports.\n3.7 Does the district prohibit processing of requisitions or purchase orders when the budget\nis insufficient to support the expenditure? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \u2713 \u2610 \u2610\n3.8 Does the district encumber and adjust encumbrances for salaries and benefits? . . . . . . \u2610 \u2713 \u2610\nThe district does not encumber salaries and benefits.\n3.9 Are all balance sheet accounts in the general ledger reconciled at least at each interim\nreport and at year end close? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\u2610 \u2713 \u2610\nThe district did not provide FCMAT evidence that balance sheet accounts in the\ngeneral ledger are reconciled at least at each interim report and at year-end close.\nFiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team San Francisco Unified School District 13",

The calculation of the plant services costs attributed to general\nadministration and included in the pool is standardized and automated using the percentage of salaries and benefits relating to general administration as proxy for the\npercentage of square footage occupied by general administration.\nA.

These additional costs can be categorized as \"normal\" or \"abnormal\nor mass\" separation costs.\nNormal separation costs include items such as pay for accumulated unused leave or routine severance pay authorized by governing board\npolicy. Normal separation costs are not allowable as direct costs to federal programs, but are allowable as indirect costs. State programs\nmay have similar restrictions. Where federal or state program guidelines required that the LEA charge an employee's normal separation\ncosts to an unrestricted resource rather than to the restricted program in which the employee worked, the LEA may identify and enter\nthese costs on Line A for inclusion in the indirect cost pool.\nAbnormal or mass separation costs are those costs resulting from actions taken by an LEA to influence employees to terminate their\nemployment earlier than they normally would have. Abnormal or mass separation costs include retirement incentives such as a Golden\nHandshake or severance packages negotiated to effect termination. Abnormal or mass separation costs may not be charged to federal\nprograms as either direct costs or indirect costs. Where an LEA paid abnormal or mass separation costs on behalf of positions in general\nadministrative functions included in the indirect cost pool, the LEA must identify and enter these costs on Line B for exclusion from the pool.\nA. Normal Separation Costs (optional)\nEnter any normal separation costs paid on behalf of employees of restricted state or federal programs that\nwere charged to an unrestricted resource (0000-1999) in funds 01, 09, and 62 with functions 1000-6999 or 8100-8400\nrather than to the restricted program.

The carry-forward adjustment eliminates\nthe need for LEAs to file amended federal reports when their actual indirect costs vary from the estimated indirect costs on which the\napproved rate was based.\nWhere the ratio of indirect costs incurred in the current year is less than the estimated ratio of indirect costs on which the approved rate for\nuse in the current year was based, the carry-forward adjustment is limited by using either the approved rate times current year base costs,\nor the highest rate actually used to recover costs from any program times current year base costs, if the highest rate used was less than\nthe approved rate.

Preliminary carry-forward adjustment (Line C1 or C2) 4,967,050.17\nE. Optional allocation of negative carry-forward adjustment over more than one year\nWhere a negative carry-forward adjustment causes the proposed approved rate to fall below zero or would reduce the rate at which\nthe LEA could recover indirect costs to such an extent that it would cause the LEA significant fiscal harm, the LEA may request that\nthe carry-forward adjustment be allocated over more than one year. Where allocation of a negative carry-forward adjustment over more\nthan one year does not resolve a negative rate, the CDE will work with the LEA on a case-by-case basis to establish an approved rate.\nOption 1.

The calculation of the plant services costs attributed to general\nadministration and included in the pool is standardized and automated using the percentage of salaries and benefits relating to general administration as proxy for the\npercentage of square footage occupied by general administration.\nA.

These additional costs can be categorized as \"normal\" or \"abnormal\nor mass\" separation costs.\nNormal separation costs include items such as pay for accumulated unused leave or routine severance pay authorized by governing board\npolicy. Normal separation costs are not allowable as direct costs to federal programs, but are allowable as indirect costs. State programs\nmay have similar restrictions. Where federal or state program guidelines required that the LEA charge an employee's normal separation\ncosts to an unrestricted resource rather than to the restricted program in which the employee worked, the LEA may identify and enter\nthese costs on Line A for inclusion in the indirect cost pool.\nAbnormal or mass separation costs are those costs resulting from actions taken by an LEA to influence employees to terminate their\nemployment earlier than they normally would have. Abnormal or mass separation costs include retirement incentives such as a Golden\nHandshake or severance packages negotiated to effect termination. Abnormal or mass separation costs may not be charged to federal\nprograms as either direct costs or indirect costs. Where an LEA paid abnormal or mass separation costs on behalf of positions in general\nadministrative functions included in the indirect cost pool, the LEA must identify and enter these costs on Line B for exclusion from the pool.\nA. Normal Separation Costs (optional)\nEnter any normal separation costs paid on behalf of employees of restricted state or federal programs that\nwere charged to an unrestricted resource (0000-1999) in funds 01, 09, and 62 with functions 1000-6999 or 8100-8400\nrather than to the restricted program. These costs will be moved in Part III from base costs to the indirect cost pool.\nRetain supporting documentation.\nB. Abnormal or Mass Separation Costs (required)\nEnter any abnormal or mass separation costs paid on behalf of general administrative positions charged to Entry required\nunrestricted resources (0000-1999) in funds 01, 09, and 62 with functions 7200-7700.

    "2": "San Francisco Unified School District\n2024-25 1st Interim Budget\nExecutive Summary\nIntroduction\nThisExecutive Summary provides an overview of the financial data reported in the 2024-25 1st Interim\nBudget Report for the San Francisco Unified School District . The report summarizes changes and\nupdates in budgetary information and fiscal forecasts approved by the Board of Trustees to address\nevolving financial projections.\nThis document applies to the period July 1, 2024, through October 31, 2024, for the San Francisco\nUnified School District\u2019s 2024-25 1st Interim Budget Report\nLegislative Analyst\u2019s Office (LAO) Budget Update\nThe LAO released its 2025-26 Budget Fiscal Outlook, as it does every November for the subsequent\nbudget year. The report focuses on Proposition 98 related to TK-12 and community college agencies.\nThis multiyear review is the first report looking at the subsequent budget year prior to the Governor\u2019s\nJanuary Budget release.\nRevenue Trends: The report indicates revenues are better than previously projected. However, this\nnews comes with a caution of offsets to the revenue with higher spending. There is the anticipation that\n2025-26 will have a fairly balanced budget, but the LAO does provide a caution of deficits in the years\nbeyond 2025-26 based on high spending obligations and will require action by lawmakers to address\nprogram reductions and/or increased revenue.\nProposition 98 Update: Proposition 98 has been revised showing an increase of $3 billion more than\nthe original 2024-25 Enacted Budget. Although Proposition 98 is up, the funds will be required to be\ndeposited into the Proposition 98 reserve under the State Constitution guidelines related to capital\ngains.\nStatutory COLA Projections: The LAO\u2019s forecast of the statutory COLA increases to above-average\ntrends of 3.00% beginning in 2026-27 through the 2028-29. The Proposition 98 costs associated with\nestimated outyear COLAs are $3.2 billion, $4.0 billion, and $4.3 billion in 2026-27, 2027-28, and\n2028-29, respectively.\nBased on the report, we can expect very little to no changes to happen even though there are modest\nincreases that are offset by increased expenses. There are still several months of hearings before the\nMay Revise will be released, which is a key component for K-12 educational agencies to complete\nbudget development for 2025-26.\nSFUSD 2024-25 1st Interim Fiscal Overview\nThe 2024-25 1st Interim Budget reflects an increase of approximately $3.4 million in LCFF revenues\ncompared to the Adopted Budget. However, the District continues to face financial challenges\nstemming from a combination of declining enrollment, reduced average daily attendance (ADA), and a\nlower-than-expected Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA).\nKey insights include:\n\u25cf Revenue Impact: While LCFF revenues are slightly higher, the trifecta of declining enrollment,\nADA reductions, and low COLA significantly constraints overall revenue growth for the fiscal\nyear.",
    "3": "\u25cf Multi-Year Budget Outlook: The District projects the need for substantial expense reductions to\nmaintain financial stability:\n\u25cb $113.2 million in 2025-26\n\u25cb $13 million in 2026-27\nThese reductions are necessary to meet the 2% reserve requirement for economic uncertainties and\nmaintain a positive cash balance.\nFiscal Sustainability: The District must prioritize addressing its fiscal condition in the coming months\nto align expenses with available revenues and sustain long-term financial health.\nProactive planning and diligent financial management remain essential to navigate these challenges\nand ensure compliance with reserve requirements while supporting the District\u2019s educational mission.\nEnrollment / ADA\nThis 2024-25 1st Interim projected an enrollment of 49,001. The P-2 ADA projection for 2024-25 is\n45,528 (excluding COE program students). The 1st Interim projected Funded ADA is 45,682. The\nEducation Code provides financial safeguards for districts to be funded in the budget year on a\nthree-year average to mitigate the decline in enrollment and ADA.\nRevenue Summary\nLocal Control Funding Formula (LCFF)\nThe District uses the FCMAT calculator to project the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) revenues.\nFor 2024-25 1st Interim, the total LCFF revenue is calculated at $13,825 per ADA, reflecting a slight\nincrease from $13,675 per ADA in the prior year. Included is also a 20% supplemental grant above the\nbase for eligible students identified through an unduplicated count as Free & Reduced lunch eligible,",
    "4": "English Language Learners, and Foster Youth. This population of students generates additional\nconcentration grants for eligible students exceeding 55% Unduplicated Pupil Percentage (UPP). At 1st\nInterim, the District\u2019s estimated enrollment for targeted eligible students totals an estimated 58.20%. The\nDistrict\u2019s total LCFF, including supplemental funding at 1st Interim, totals $634.4 million for 2024-25 and\nrepresents a decrease of $12.7 million over the prior year.\nRevenues \u2013 Federal/Other State/Other Local\nFederal Revenues\nThe District\u2019s Federal Revenues are projected to increase at 1st Interim by $11.4 million. This increase is\nattributed to carryover funds and current-year grant allocations.\nOther State/Other Local Revenues\nOther State Revenues are estimated to increase by $14.2 million as compared to the Adopted Budget due\nto carryover and current-year funding. The Local Revenues are projected to increase by $22 million.\nExpenditure Summary\nThe District\u2019s estimated expenditures for 2024-25 total $1.4 billion.\nCertificated and Classified Salaries and Benefits\nTotal Salary and Benefits decreased by approximately $16.5 million due to the reduction of Other\nPost-Employment Benefits (OPEB) rate for retiree health benefits.\nBooks, Supplies, Contracted Services, and Capital Outlay\nIn the category of Books, Supplies, Contracted Services, and Capital Outlay, costs are projected to\nincrease by approximately $98.2 million, driven by operational and programmatic needs.\nContributions\nSpecial Education costs are projected to increase by $41 million, while Routine Repair and Maintenance\nexpenditures are expected to rise by $51,000. Additionally, Transportation costs are anticipated to\ndecrease, by $29,220.",
    "5": "Ending Balance Summary\nThe District projects an ending fund balance of $286.4 million for the 2024-25 1st Interim. The State\nrequires a District our size to maintain an ending reserve equal to 2% of total expenditures and other\nuses. For the 1st Interim, the District\u2019s 2% Economic Uncertainty is $28.2 million.\nComponents of the Ending Fund Balance\nComponents of Ending Fund Balance\nRevolving Cash $ 1,875,150\nLegally Restricted $ 167,703,764\nStabilization $ 14,874,876\nOther Commitments $ 60,000,000\nEconomic Uncertainty 2% $ 28,200,000\nOther Assignments $ 13,743,167\nGASB 31/72 FMV $ 8,743167\nTransition ERP $ 5,000,000\nTotal Ending Fund Balance $ 286,396,966\nGeneral Fund Restricted\nLegally restricted funds are funds received by the District that can only be used for the purposes\nallowed by the funding agency. Restricted revenue funding is recognized in two ways; it is either\nrecognized as deferred revenue, which means it is recognized as revenue once it is spent, or if received\nand not spent and has carry-over provisions, the funds are deferred until the next fiscal year. For\nfunding subject to ending fund balance, the revenue is recognized in the year received and any funds\nremaining at the end of the year are recorded as a restricted ending balance. As of the 2024-25 1st\nInterim Restricted General fund carry-over is estimated at $167.7 million.\nChild Nutrition Fund 13 (Other Funds)\nThe adopted budget indicated that the District\u2019s cafeteria fund is projected to have a $16.3 million\nending fund balance. This fund does not require a contribution from the General Fund Unrestricted\nbudget at this time.\nLocal Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) Budget\nThe Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) budget is included within the District\u2019s unrestricted\ngeneral fund. The District\u2019s LCAP budget provides supplemental services to the District\u2019s English",
    "6": "Language Learners, economically disadvantaged, migrant education students throughout the District,\nand Foster Youth. The Local Control Accountability Plan augments and provides supplemental support\nservices. The LCFF (supplemental) revenue is projected to be $77.8 million.\nMulti-Year Financial Projection\nThe 2024-25 Multi-Year Projection (MYP) for the 1st Interim indicates that the District meets its 2%\nDistrict mandated reserve in 2024-25. However, the District will require reductions in 2025-26 and\n2026-27 to meet the statutory reserve levels in each fiscal year. To address the budget shortfall and to\nensure a positive budget forecast, the Board will need to adopt another Fiscal Solvency Resolution to\nreduce expenditures in 2025-26 by $113.2 million for 2025-26 and $13 for 26-27.\nThe multi-year projections are based on assumptions listed in this report and include estimates for\nCOLA, current bargained agreements, health and benefit increases, step and column adjustments,\nstatutory benefit contribution rate increases, enrollment fluctuations, and other variables. The\nMulti-Year Financial Projection assumes that the District will continue to operate in the same manner\nwith all ongoing costs considerations currently in place.\nThe District is currently in a Negative status for certification and will require budget reductions to\nmaintain fiscal solvency. The projections account for costs associated with step and column\nadjustments, utilities, and other ongoing expenditures such as contributions to Routine, Restricted\nMaintenance, and Special Education.\nMulti-Year Financial Projection Summary for the General Fund\nSFUSD Unrestricted and Restricted General Fund Projections\nBefore Implementation of Planned Adjustments\n($ in Millions)\nSFUSD 2024\u201325 2025\u201326 2026\u201327\nTOTALS\nBeginning Fund Balance $468.20 $286.60 $71.00\nDeficit Spending Before Planned Adjustments ($181.50) ($215.40) ($63.10)\nEnding Fund Balance $286.60 $71.00 $7.90\nRestricted Balance\nMinimum 2% Reserve for Economic Uncertainties $28.20 $28.60 $26.60\nMinimum Reserve Level Met Yes No No\nFinal Comments\nThe recommendation to the Governing Board is to provide staff with the appropriate directive to take\nthe necessary action to further assess the fiscal condition of the District in preparation for the\nexpenditure reductions by March 15 ,2025. The reductions outlined in the Fiscal Solvency Plan, are\nessential to meet the positive certification requirements over the next two years and maintain a positive\nending fund balance. The proposed reductions directly address our current challenges, such as",
    "7": "declining enrollment, the loss of one-time funds, increased costs associated with salary settlements,\npension contributions, special education additional costs, and health benefit costs.\nIn summary, the District will continue to be proactive and vigilant in managing its fiscal resources\nwhile ensuring that our schools, teachers, staff, and students have the resources they need to maintain\nthe excellent educational program the community has come to enjoy and respect. The District will\nwork with its stakeholders to explore cost savings strategies and revenue enhancement efforts to\nprovide relief to the District\u2019s budget.\nOn behalf of the Superintendent, a special thanks is extended to our Governing Board, Staff,\nStudents, Parents, and Stakeholders for their continued support!",

The calculation of the plant services costs attributed to general\nadministration and included in the pool is standardized and automated using the percentage of salaries and benefits relating to general administration as proxy for the\npercentage of square footage occupied by general administration.\nA.

These additional costs can be categorized as \"normal\" or \"abnormal\nor mass\" separation costs.\nNormal separation costs include items such as pay for accumulated unused leave or routine severance pay authorized by governing board\npolicy. Normal separation costs are not allowable as direct costs to federal programs, but are allowable as indirect costs. State programs\nmay have similar restrictions. Where federal or state program guidelines required that the LEA charge an employee's normal separation\ncosts to an unrestricted resource rather than to the restricted program in which the employee worked, the LEA may identify and enter\nthese costs on Line A for inclusion in the indirect cost pool.\nAbnormal or mass separation costs are those costs resulting from actions taken by an LEA to influence employees to terminate their\nemployment earlier than they normally would have. Abnormal or mass separation costs include retirement incentives such as a Golden\nHandshake or severance packages negotiated to effect termination. Abnormal or mass separation costs may not be charged to federal\nprograms as either direct costs or indirect costs. Where an LEA paid abnormal or mass separation costs on behalf of positions in general\nadministrative functions included in the indirect cost pool, the LEA must identify and enter these costs on Line B for exclusion from the pool.\nA. Normal Separation Costs (optional)\nEnter any normal separation costs paid on behalf of employees of restricted state or federal programs that\nwere charged to an unrestricted resource (0000-1999) in funds 01, 09, and 62 with functions 1000-6999 or 8100-8400\nrather than to the restricted program.

We\nconducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards,\nissued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from\nmaterial misstatement.\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in\nthe financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor\u2019s judgment, including the\nassessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or\nerror. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity\u2019s\npreparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that\nare appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the\neffectiveness of the entity\u2019s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also\nincludes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of\nsignificant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of\nthe financial statements.\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for\nour audit opinions.\nWhat inspires you, inspires us. | eidebailly.com 1\n4040 Campbell Ave., Ste. 200 | Menlo Park, CA 94025-1053 | T 650.522.3400 | F 650.645.7393 | EOE",

Our opinions are not modified with respect to this matter.\nOther Matters\nRequired Supplementary Information\nAccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the management\u2019s\ndiscussion and analysis, budgetary comparison information, schedule of changes in the District\u2019s net\nOPEB liability and related ratios, schedule of District contributions for OPEB, schedule of the District\u2019s\nproportionate share of the net pension liability, and the schedule of pension contributions on page 4\nthrough 16 and 74 through 80, be presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such\ninformation, although not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by the Governmental\nAccounting Standards Board, who considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing\nthe basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have\napplied certain limited procedures to the required supplementary information in accordance with\nauditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which consisted of inquiries of\nmanagement about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the information for\nconsistency with management\u2019s responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements, and other\nknowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not express an opinion\nor provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with\nsufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance.\nOther Information\nOur audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that\ncollectively comprise the District\u2019s financial statements. The Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards\nas required by the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 200, Uniform\nAdministrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform\nGuidance) and other supplementary information listed in the table of contents are presented for\npurposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of the basic financial statements.\nThe Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards and the other supplementary information is the\nresponsibility of management and were derived from and relate directly to the underlying accounting\nand other records used to prepare the basic financial statements. Such information has been subjected\nto the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and certain additional\nprocedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting\nand other records used to prepare the basic financial statements or to the basic financial statements\nthemselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted\nin the United States of America.

The San Francisco Unified\nSchool District was established in 1851. The District is governed by an elected Board of seven members. The\nDistrict also administers the County Office of Education.\nThe District and County Office of Education provide pre-kindergarten, transitional kindergarten, kindergarten,\nelementary, middle and secondary education in the City and County of San Francisco through a network of 136\nschools as follows:\n12 early education schools\n64 elementary schools (TK-5)\n8 alternatively configured schools (TK-8)\n13 middle schools (6-8)\n14 high schools (9-12)\n3 continuation/alternative schools, including an independent study school\n8 court and county community schools and programs\n14 district-authorized charter schools\nThe majority of the District\u2019s elementary schools have designated attendance areas giving priority to students\nliving within those attendance boundaries. The remaining elementary schools are \u201cCity-wide schools\u201d with no\ndesignated attendance area. Each middle school is linked to several elementary schools through feeder patterns;\nhowever, all SFUSD schools enroll students based on parent/guardian request and provide significant\nopportunities for parental choice in enrollment.\nThe District is also the chartering entity and has oversight responsibility for fourteen charter schools: City Arts\nand Technology High School, Creative Arts Charter School, Five Keys Charter School, Five Keys Adult School, Five\nKeys Independence High School, Gateway High School, Gateway Middle School, KIPP Bayview Academy, KIPP\nSan Francisco Bay Academy, KIPP San Francisco College Preparatory, Leadership High School, Life Learning\nAcademy, Thomas Edison Charter Academy and Mission Preparatory.\nThe District\u2019s diverse student demographics includes 30% Asian, 33% Hispanic, 14% White, 7% African American,\n3% Filipino, 1% Pacific Islander and 12% \u201cOther\u201d. Approximately 26% of the student population is designated as\nEnglish Language Learners, 16% Special Education and 50% is free and reduced-price lunch eligible. This diverse\npopulation enriches SFUSD and calls for focused investments to support varying socioeconomic and learning\nneeds of its students.\n4",

Beyond the Talk represented our community\u2019s bold aspirational goals that have\nremained unchanged, while we continue our deep and unrelenting commitment to our three District goals:\nAccess and Equity \u2013 Make social justice a reality by ensuring every student has access to high quality\nteaching and learning.\nStudent Achievement \u2013 Create learning environments in all SFUSD schools that foster highly engaged and\njoyful learners and that support every student reaching their potential.\nAccountability \u2013 Keep district promises to students and families and enlist everyone in the community to\njoin in doing so.\nNext, in the fall of 2013, the District developed a new vision to transform the city\u2019s school system, through\nTransform Learning, Transform Lives. A Guidebook Towards Vision 2025, which can be found at\nhttps://www.sfusd.edu/about-sfusd/our-mission-and-vision/vision-2025. Vision 2025 aimed to establish SFUSD\nas one of the premier systems in the world by ensuring that all students graduate from high school with the\nskills, capacities and dispositions for 21st Century success through:\nContent Knowledge \u2013 Help our students master the fundamentals in math, English, computer science and\nart, and develop problem-solving and critical analytical skills.\nCreativity \u2013 Provide opportunities for our students to be creative, tackle environmental problems and make\ncommunities more inclusive.\nCareer and Life Skills \u2013 Help students to acquire knowledge, skills, and experience they need to navigate in\nthe world, think critically and communicate effectively.\nGlobal, Local and Digital Identity \u2013 Help to equip students with the skills of the future, including learning\nnew languages, understanding new technologies, and participating in local apprenticeships.\nLeadership, Empathy, and Collaboration \u2013 Organize and encourage teamwork and collaboration, both with\npeers and partners outside the classroom, such as family members and mentors.\nSense of Purpose and Sense of Self \u2013 Nurture our students\u2019 growth and teach them life lessons so they can\nrecognize their purpose and value, and encourage each student to reach their full potential, whether they\nrequire extra support or a new challenge.\nThe District's current Superintendent, Dr. Vincent C. Matthews, was hired in May, 2017 and has continued the\nwork of building a rigorous Common Core-based curriculum, investing in the professional learning of teachers,\nleaders and school staff, enlisting partners and engaging families, and building an accountability system that\nincludes a comprehensive assessment of student learning, all in service of Vision 2025.\nThe strategic focus of the District has resulted in improved educational outcomes for its students. The 2019\nSBAC results show SFUSD students remaining ahead of their peers in California and in most large urban districts\nin both English Language Arts and Mathematics. 55% of district students overall are now meeting or exceeding\nthe standards in English Language Arts, up from 55% in the previous year, and higher than the state average of\n51%. In Math, 51% of students are now meeting or exceeding the standards, which is no change from the prior\nyear, and higher than the state average of 40%.\n5",
    "9": "San Francisco Unified School District\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nJune 30, 2021\nAccording to new data released from the California Department of Education (CDE) School Dashboard, the\ngraduation rate for the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) rose to 88.3% in the 2020-21 school year,\ncompared to 87.3% in 2019-20 and 83.6% statewide. The greatest improvements were seen with African\nAmerican and Special Education students.\nLocal Funding Sources\nSecuring local revenues has been a critical strategy for helping the District meet its goals, by increasing resources\nfor students and providing competitive salaries and professional development opportunities in order to recruit\nand retain high quality educators.\nFirst, in June 2008, Proposition A, the Quality Teacher & Education Act (\u201cQTEA\u201d), was passed by the voters of\nSan Francisco to deliver over $40 million annually to the District for the next twenty years, through fiscal year\n2028-29. These resources assist in recruiting and retaining effective teachers, supporting innovative instructional\nstrategies, increasing accountability, and improving the District\u2019s technology infrastructure. The District received\n$44.9 million of QTEA funding in FY 2020-21.\nAdditionally, the Public Education Enrichment Fund (PEEF), was approved by the voters of San Francisco in\nMarch, 2004, and re-established in 2014. The district receives two-thirds of the annual PEEF allocation from the\nCity with the remaining one-third going to the City\u2019s Department of Early Care and Education for support to\npreschool. The district\u2019s portion of PEEF is used to support sports, libraries, the arts and music (SLAM) as well as\nprograms such as Wellness Centers, Student Support Professionals at schools, Translation Services, STEAM\ncurriculum, and Peer Resources, to name a few. The District received $71.1 million of PEEF revenue in 2020-21.\nFinally, the Living Wage for Educators Act (LWEA) parcel tax measure was passed by voters in 2018 with a 61%\nvote. In 2020, LWEA was replaced by the Fair Wages for Educators Act (FWEA) to secure a 74% voter approval\nand generate over $48 million annually through to fiscal year 2038. Both LWEA and FWEA support targeted\nincreases to educator salaries and professional development.\nFinancial Highlights\nBudgeting\nThe SFUSD adopted budget is developed based on the latest information on revenue projections received from\nthe Governor\u2019s May revision to the state budget, which is typically released a few months before the final State\nbudget is passed. The District held budget hearings and adopted the FY 2020-21 budget in accordance with\nprovisions of the California Education Code. The budget reflects the District\u2019s goals to emphasize the\nachievement of all students and to narrow the achievement gap for our African-American students. Throughout\nthe budget development process, staff is encouraged to work with the community to develop sound decisions\nthat support the needs of all students.\n6",

Additional programs are\nbudgeted as grant awards are received during the course of the year. Grants are budgeted to be fully expended.\nCarryover funds are budgeted when carryover balances are determined and per instructions from program\nmanagers. As program needs change during the year, changes and revisions to the adopted budget are made\nthroughout the year to reflect these changes. Budget transfers and budget revisions are made on an ongoing\nbasis, and new programs are budgeted throughout the fiscal year. We have included a budgetary comparison\nschedule on page 74 providing the adopted and final budgets compared with actual revenues and expenditures.\nUnrestricted General Fund Results of Operations\nDuring fiscal year 2020-21, the District\u2019s unrestricted general fund ending balance, which includes\nnonspendable, and unassigned balances, increased from $9.8 million to $42.8 million, a $33.0 million or 337%\nincrease due to the receipt of nonrecurring Federal grants and deliberate efforts to increase budget stabilization\nreserves to help address anticipated future year deficits.\nCompared to the previous fiscal year, unrestricted general fund revenues were $603.1 million, an increase of\n$9.8 million, or 1.7%, and unrestricted general fund expenditures and transfers out were $570.2 million, a\ndecrease of $54.1 million or 8.7%. This is due primarily to operating savings that resulted from the pandemic.\nincrease in employee salaries negotiated under a new three year contract that became effective as of the start\nof the fiscal year as well as increases in the CALSTRS retirement contribution rate. Total salaries increased by 7%\nto $305.6 million from $285.5 million the previous year, while the employer contribution rate for teachers\u2019\nretirement rose from 14.43% of certificated payroll to 17.10% of certificated payroll, a 2.67% increase.\nThe general fund contributed to the child development program (Fund 12), the cafeteria program (Fund 13),\nand the deferred maintenance fund (Fund 14). Transfers to other funds in the amount of $15.8 million are $4.4\nmillion or 28% higher than 2019-20 levels due to an end of year balance in the 81500 Maintenance Reserve in\nFund 01 resulting from operating savings during the pandemic that should be used to address deferred\nmaintenance needs.\nGeneral Fund Ending Balance and Reserves\nThe District\u2019s combined general fund ending balance on June 30, 2021 (restricted plus unrestricted) was $126.2\nmillion. The restricted portion of $85.0 million will broadly be used for instructional activities, although its use is\nrestricted for specific program activities and cannot be counted as available (unrestricted reserves). The\nDistrict\u2019s available reserves, consisting of amounts designated for economic uncertainty and other unassigned\nfund balances of the general fund, were $39.7 million, an increase of $30.8 million or 344% over the fiscal year\n2019-20. Much of the increase is due to deliberate efforts to maximize the use of non-recurring COVID related\nfederal funds and build up budget stabilization reserves to help address anticipated future year deficits.\n7",

The basic financial statements include two kinds\nof statements that present different views of the District:\n\u2022 The first two statements are government-wide financial statements that provide both short-term and\nlong-term information about the District\u2019s overall financial status.\n\u2022 The remaining statements are fund financial statements that focus on individual parts of the District,\nreporting the District\u2019s operations in more detail than the government-wide statements.\n\u2022 The governmental funds statements tell how basic services like regular and special education were\nfinanced in the short term as well as what remains for future spending.\n\u2022 Proprietary fund statements offer financial information about the activities the District operates on a cost\nreimbursement basis, such as the Self-insurance Fund.\n\u2022 Fiduciary funds statements provide information about the financial relationships in which the District acts\nsolely as a trustee or agent for the benefit of others to whom the resources belong. Fiduciary fund activity\nis excluded from the government-wide financial statements.\nThe financial statements also include notes that explain some of the information in the statements and provide\nmore detailed data. The statements are followed by a section of required supplementary information that\nfurther explains and supports the financial statements with comparisons of the District\u2019s General and County\nSchool Service Fund budgets, both the adopted and final version, with year-end actuals.\nGovernment-Wide Statements\nThe government-wide statements report information about the District as a whole using accounting methods\nsimilar to those used by private-sector companies. The statement of net position includes all of the District\u2019s\nassets and liabilities. All of the current year\u2019s revenues and expenses are accounted for in the statement of\nactivities regardless of when cash is received or paid.\nThe two government-wide statements report the District\u2019s net position and how they have changed. Net\nposition \u2013 the difference between assets and liabilities \u2013 is one way to measure the District\u2019s financial health.\n\u2022 Over time, increases or decreases in the District\u2019s net position may be an indicator of whether its financial\nposition is improving or deteriorating, respectively.\n\u2022 To assess the overall health of the District one needs to consider additional non-financial factors such as\nchanges in the District\u2019s property tax base, its student enrollment data, the State\u2019s fiscal health and the\ncondition of school buildings and other facilities.\n9",
    "13": "San Francisco Unified School District\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nJune 30, 2021\nFund Financial Statements\nThe fund financial statements provide more detailed information about the District\u2019s most significant funds \u2013\nnot the District as a whole. Funds are accounting devices the District uses to keep track of specific sources of\nfunding and spending on particular programs:\n\u2022 Some funds are required by State law and by bond covenants.\n\u2022 The District establishes other funds to control and manage money for particular purposes (such as\npayment of long-term debt) or to show that it is properly using certain revenues (such as Federal grants).\nThe District has three kinds of funds:\n\u2022 Governmental funds \u2013 Most of the District\u2019s basic services are included in governmental funds, which\ngenerally focus on (1) how cash and other financial assets that can readily be converted to cash flow in\nand out and (2) the balances left at year-end that are available for spending. Consequently, the\ngovernmental funds statements provide a detailed short-term view that helps one determine whether\nthere are more or fewer financial resources that can be spent in the near future to finance the District\u2019s\nprograms. Because this information does not encompass the additional long-term focus of the district-\nwide statements, reconciliations between the district-wide statements and the fund financial statements\nare provided.\n\u2022 Proprietary funds \u2013 Services for which the District charges a fee are generally reported in proprietary\nfunds. The District uses one internal service fund \u2013 the self-insurance fund \u2013 to account for and report\nactivities related to the self-insured workers compensation program.\n\u2022 Fiduciary funds \u2013 The District holds assets in a custodial capacity that belong to external entities such as\ncharter schools. The District is responsible for remitting the payroll withholding to benefit providers and\ntaxing authorities on behalf of these external entities.

    "14": "San Francisco Unified School District\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nJune 30, 2021\nReporting the District as A Whole\nThe Statement of Net Position and the Statement of Activities\nThe statement of net position and the statement of activities report information about the District as a whole\nand about its activities. These statements include all assets and liabilities of the District using the accrual basis of\naccounting, which is similar to the accounting used by most private-sector companies. All of the current year's\nrevenues and expenses are taken into account regardless of when cash is received or paid.\nThese two statements report the District's net position and changes in them. Net position is the difference\nbetween assets and deferred outflows of resources, and liabilities and deferred inflows of resources, which is\none way to measure the District's financial health, or financial position. Over time, increases or decreases in the\nDistrict's net position will serve as a useful indicator of whether the financial position of the District is improving\nor deteriorating. Other factors to consider are changes in the District's property tax base and the condition of\nthe District's facilities.\nThe relationship between revenues and expenses is the District's operating results. Since the governing board's\nresponsibility is to provide services to our students and not to generate profit as commercial entities do, one\nmust consider other factors when evaluating the overall health of the District. The quality of the education and\nthe safety of our schools will likely be an important component in this evaluation.\nThe statement of net position and the statement of activities report all of the District\u2019s financial activity as in\nsupport of \u201cgovernmental activities.\u201d Governmental activities includes the education of kindergarten through\ngrade twelve students, county office of education programs, the operation of child development activities, and\nthe on-going effort to improve and maintain buildings and sites. Property taxes, state income taxes, user fees,\ninterest income, federal, state, and local grants, as well as general obligation bonds, finance these activities.\nReporting the District's Most Significant Funds\nFund Financial Statements\nThe fund financial statements provide detailed information about the most significant funds - not the District as\na whole. Some funds are required to be established by state law and by bond covenants. However, management\nestablishes many other funds to help it control and manage money for particular purposes or to show that it is\nmeeting legal responsibilities for using certain taxes, grants, and other money that it receives from the\nU.S. Department of Education.\n11",
    "15": "San Francisco Unified School District\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nJune 30, 2021\nGovernmental Funds\nMost of the District's basic services are reported in governmental funds, which focus on how money flows into\nand out of those funds and the balances left at year-end that are available for spending. These funds are\nreported using an accounting method called modified accrual accounting, which measures cash and all other\nfinancial assets that can readily be converted to cash. The governmental fund statements provide a detailed\nshort-term view of the District's general government operations and the basic services it provides.\nGovernmental fund information helps determine whether there are more or fewer financial resources that can\nbe spent in the near future to finance the District's programs. The differences of results in the governmental\nfund financial statements to those in the government-wide financial statements are explained in a reconciliation\nfollowing each governmental fund financial statement.\nProprietary Funds\nWe use an internal service fund (a component of proprietary funds) to report activities that provide supplies and\nservices for the District's other programs and activities, such as the District's self-insured workers compensation\nprogram. This activity is reported with governmental activities in the government-wide financial statements.\nThe District as A Trustee\nReporting the Districts Fiduciary Responsibilities\nThe District is the trustee, or fiduciary, for funds held on behalf of external entities. We exclude these activities\nfrom the District's other financial statements because the District cannot use these assets to finance its\noperations. The District is responsible for ensuring that the assets reported in these funds are used for their\nintended purposes.\nCapital Assets and Debt Administration\nFor financial accounting purposes, capital assets are valued at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and\nare not intended to present an estimate of fair market value. At the close of the year ended June 30, 2021, the\nDistrict\u2019s capital assets totaled $2,673 million. Accumulated depreciation was $764.8 million at year end.\nDepreciation expense for the year totaled $64.7 million. Net book value (the amount of total assets after\napplying depreciation) increased by $123.6 million to $1,907 million.\nThe historical construction cost of most school sites dating back to the date the school district was first opened\nhave not been included as such costs would have been fully depreciated when accounting standards required\nsuch information to be reported.

The aggregate net pension liability increased $104.1 million or 12.4% from June 30, 2020.\nThe other postemployment benefits liability increased $230.2 million or 29.4% from June 30, 2020. A\nreconciliation of the unrestricted deficit net position and the positive unassigned general fund is on page 50.\nFactors Bearing on the District\u2019s Future\nThe District\u2019s financial outlook relies heavily upon its ability to address its structural budget deficit, restore\nreserves, and address its long-term pension and retiree benefits liabilities, all amidst the challenges of operating\na district through the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) pandemic.\n13",
    "17": "San Francisco Unified School District\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nJune 30, 2021\nBudget Stabilization\nEven before the pandemic began, SFUSD faced a structural budget deficit. For several years the District drew\ndown its reserves as revenue growth failed to keep up with the growing cost of running the seventh largest\nschool district in the one of the costliest, yet high poverty cities in the state. Over that time, the District aimed to\ncontrol costs by carving back at its Central Office, yet in FY 2019-20 it was clear that deeper reductions would be\nrequired to stabilize the budget. Then, with school closures and the rollout of distance learning to address the\nspread of COVID-19 in San Francisco as well as across the state and country, SFUSD was forced to address the\neducational crisis of our century with constrained resources.\nThe availability of federal stimulus funds and one-time state resources allowed the District to balance its budget\nand address new pandemic-driven costs between FY 2020-21 and FY 2021-22. In FY 2020-21, federal stimulus\nfunding and the dedication of state funding helped SFUSD address the bulk of its $57 million budget deficit.\nAgain, in FY 2021-22, a total of $119 million federal stimulus funding was used to address a budget deficit of\n$100.2 million, allowing SFUSD to welcome all students back to more stable in-person classrooms and maintain\na reserve to address unforeseen expenses related to the pandemic. By avoiding destabilizing budget cuts to\ndate, SFUSD has been able to provide social-emotional and learning recovery support as students transition back\nfrom distance learning, possible learning loss, social isolation, and other hardships. However, due to the one-\ntime nature of the federal stimulus funds to address prior year deficits, the District still must address a major\nstructural deficit, including projected budget shortfalls of $125 million in FY 2022-23 and $143 million in FY\n2023-24.\nIn its September 15, 2021 letter to the District\u2019s Superintendent, the California Department of Education (CDE)\ndirected SFUSD to develop a balancing plan by December 2021 and submit a balanced budget by July 1, 2022.\nAdditionally, CDE assigned two fiscal experts to help guide the District through the budget balancing process.\nSFUSD responded to these directives by implementing a Zero-Based Budget process in the Fall of 2021 that\naimed to prioritize District spending in three categories: Core Services, District Priorities, and Service\nEnhancements. Budget reductions aimed to scale back Service Enhancements, identify ways to configure the\ndelivery of Core and Priority services more efficiently, and preserve high leverage and high impact investments.\nStaff engaged with school site leaders, labor partners, parent groups, and other stakeholders who will offer\nvaluable perspectives that inform our strategies. By organizing the budget processes in this way, all effort was\nmade to minimize harm to students as a result of budget cuts.\nOn December 14, 2021, the Board of Education approved an FY 2022-23 and FY 2023-24 Budget Balancing Plan\nthat will be revisited as part of the District\u2019s FY 2021-22 Second Interim Report. The current plan includes $90\nmillion expenditure reductions and $35 million new one-time and ongoing funding sources. With an improved\nrevenue outlook in the Governor\u2019s January Budget, the District expects to restore a portion of funding to school\nsite budgets, direct services, and central office services that most support students. As the District moves to\naddress its structural deficit, it is critical that the use of one-time sources is limited and expenditures are\nreduced to align with student enrollment and projected ongoing revenues.\n14",
    "18": "San Francisco Unified School District\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nJune 30, 2021\nReserves and Liabilities\nRestoring District reserves and addressing long term liabilities are also critical for building a path towards fiscal\nstability and sustainability. Otherwise, SFUSD will continue to be vulnerable to unforeseen economic conditions,\nsuch as the economic recession driven by COVID-19, and its balance sheet will further decline as liabilities grow\nover time. For example, SFUSD currently pays approximately $37 million annually for existing retirees and holds\na $1.0 billion unfunded liability for future retirees. If no significant investments are made to pre-fund the cost of\nretiree benefits, in 10 years (2031) the annual cost for current employees will far surpass $50 million and the\noverall liability will grow to an estimated $1.9 billion.\nThe District\u2019s success in a lawsuit in opposition to the Proposition G-Living Wages for Educators Act (\u201cLWEA\u201d)\nparcel tax is a critical turning point for addressing its reserve and liabilities. Between 2018 and 2021, $50 million\nwas withheld from SFUSD annually, totaling $150 million. Rather than halt salary increases promised under\nLWEA, the District reduced planned expenditures to $40.0 million per year and funded the $120.0 million total\nexpenses with a $26.6 million loan from the City and $93.4 million from the District\u2019s Rainy Day Reserve. As a\nresult of prevailing in the lawsuit, SFUSD received a $123.4 million payment of parcel tax revenue. Of these\nfunds, $30.0 million must be used for LWEA-eligible expenses and $93.4 million reimburses the District for prior\nLWEA-eligible expenses and may be used for other priority purposes. The San Francisco Board of Education has\nexpressed the intent to use the funds to restore $40 million to a Rainy Day Reserve and use $60 million to pre-\nfund OPEB\nOther Factors\nAs it relates to future State Budgets, the District\u2019s ability to predict what actions will be taken in the future by\nthe State Legislature and Governor to address the State\u2019s current or future budget and cash management\npractices is limited. Future State budgets will be affected by national and state economic conditions and other\nfactors over which the District has no control. Prospects for State funding are stable due to a sustained\nimprovement in California\u2019s economy and the implementation of the Local Control Funding Formula which has\nprovided increased funds to K-14 education under the Governor\u2019s budget. The State\u2019s approach to declining\nenrollment will impact SFUSD and other districts statewide.\nThe District\u2019s Superintendent and senior staff members will continue to work very closely with the Board of\nEducation to monitor revenues and manage expenditures. SFUSD is fully committed to take whatever measures\nare necessary to maintain a strong and stable financial position.

The District and County Office of Education (COE) operate under a\nlocally-elected seven-member Board form of government and provide educational services to grades K - 12 as\nmandated by state and federal agencies. The District and COE provide child care, elementary and secondary\neducation in the City and County of San Francisco, California. The District operates 8 alternatively configured\n(TK-8), 64 elementary schools, 13 middle schools, 17 senior high schools (including two continuation schools and\nan independent study school), 8 court and county community schools, 34 state-funded preschool sites, and 12\nearly education centers. The District sponsors 14 independent charter schools.\nFor financial reporting purposes, the District includes all funds, account groups, agencies, and authorities that\nare controlled by or are dependent on the District\u2019s executive or legislative branches. Control by or dependence\non the District was determined on the basis of budget adoption, taxing authority, outstanding debt secured by\nrevenues or general obligations of the District, obligations of the District to finance any deficits that may occur,\nor receipt of significant subsidies from the District.\nA reporting entity is comprised of the primary government, component units, and other organizations that are\nincluded to ensure the financial statements are not misleading. The primary government of the District consists\nof all funds, departments, boards, and agencies that are not legally separate from the District. This includes\ngeneral operations, food service and student related activities of the District and the COE.\nComponent Units\nComponent units are legally separate organizations for which the District is financially accountable. Component\nunits may include organizations that are fiscally dependent on the District in that the District approves their\nbudget, the issuance of their debt or the levying of their taxes. In addition, component units are other legally\nseparate organizations for which the District is not financially accountable but the nature and significance of the\norganization\u2019s relationship with the District is such that exclusion would cause the District\u2019s financial statements\nto be misleading or incomplete. For financial reporting purposes, the District Financing Corporation (Financing\nCorporation) component unit has a financial and operational relationship which meets the reporting entity\ndefinition criteria of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 14, The Financial Reporting\nEntity, as amended by GASB Statement No. 39, Determining Whether Certain Organizations are Component\nUnits, and GASB Statement No. 80, Blending Requirements For Certain Component Units and thus is included in\nthe financial statements using the blended presentation method as if it were part of the District\u2019s operations.\nThe governing board of the Financing Corporation is the same as the governing board of the District.

The charter schools are sponsored by the\nDistrict but operate independently. Their financial activity is not presented in the District's financial statements\nexcept for the pass-through of state aid and property tax revenues.\nBasis of Presentation - Fund Accounting\nThe accounting system is organized and operated on a fund basis. A fund is defined as a fiscal and accounting\nentity with a self-balancing set of accounts, which are segregated for the purpose of carrying on specific\nactivities or attaining certain objectives in accordance with special regulations, restrictions or limitations. The\nDistrict\u2019s funds are grouped into three broad fund categories: governmental, proprietary, and fiduciary.\nMajor Governmental Funds Governmental funds are those through which most governmental functions\ntypically are financed. Governmental fund reporting focuses on the sources, uses and balances of current\nfinancial resources. Expendable assets are assigned to the various governmental funds according to the\npurposes for which they may or must be used. Current liabilities are assigned to the fund from which they will\nbe paid. The difference between governmental fund assets and liabilities is reported as fund balance. The\nfollowing are the District\u2019s major governmental funds:\nGeneral Fund The general fund is the chief operating fund and is used to account for the ordinary operations\nof the District. All transactions except those accounted for in another fund are accounted for in this fund.\nCounty School Service Special Revenue Fund The county school service special revenue fund is used to\naccount for resources committed to special education or other school programs that would otherwise be\noperated by a county office of education, as well as to general and administrative oversight.\nBuilding Fund The building fund exists primarily to account separately for proceeds from the sale of general\nobligation bonds (Education Code Section 15146). The expenditures reported in this fund are restricted to\ncapital outlays authorized for the purpose for which the related general obligation bonds were issued.\nCapital Facilities Fund The capital facilities fund is used primarily to account separately for monies received\nfrom fees levied on developers or other agencies as a condition of approving a development (Education\nCode Sections 17620-17626). Expenditures are restricted to the purposes specified in Government Code\nSections 65970-65981 or to the items specified in agreements with the developer (Government Code\nSection 66006).\nBond Interest and Redemption Fund The bond interest and redemption fund is used for the repayment of\nbonds issued for a district (Education Code Sections 15125-15262).\n30",
    "34": "San Francisco Unified School District\nNotes to Financial Statements\nJune 30, 2021\nNonmajor Governmental Funds\nSpecial Revenue Funds The special revenue funds are used to account for the proceeds from specific revenue\nsources (other than trusts, major capital projects, or debt service) that are restricted or committed to\nexpenditures for specified purposes and that compose a substantial portion of the inflows of the fund.\nAdditional resources that are restricted, committed, or assigned to the purpose of the fund may also be\nreported in the fund.\n\u2022 Student Activity Fund The student activity fund is used to account separately for the operating activities\nof the associated student body accounts that are not fiduciary in nature, including student clubs, general\noperations, athletics, and other student body activities.\n\u2022 Cafeteria Fund The cafeteria fund is used to account separately for Federal, State, and local resources to\noperate the food service program (Education Code Sections 38090-38093) and is used only for those\nexpenditures authorized by the governing board as necessary for the operation of the District's food\nservice program (Education Code Sections 38091 and 38100).\n\u2022 Child Development Fund The child development fund is used to account separately for Federal, State, and\nlocal revenues to operate child development programs and is to be used only for expenditures for the\noperation of child development programs.\n\u2022 Deferred Maintenance Fund The deferred maintenance fund is used to account separately for revenues\nthat are restricted or committed for deferred maintenance purposes (Education Code Section 17582).\nDebt Service Funds The debt service funds are used to account for the accumulation of restricted, committed, or\nassigned resources for and the payment of principal and interest on general long-term liabilities.\n\u2022 Tax Override Fund The tax override fund is used for the repayment of voted indebtedness (other than\nBond Interest and Redemption Fund repayments) to be financed from ad valorem tax levies.\nCapital Projects Funds The capital project funds are used to account for financial resources that are restricted,\ncommitted, or assigned to the acquisition or construction of major capital facilities and other capital assets\n(other than those financed by proprietary funds and trust funds).\n\u2022 Special Reserve Fund for Capital Outlay Projects The special reserve fund for capital outlay projects exists\nprimarily to provide for the accumulation of general fund monies for capital outlay purposes (Education\nCode Section 42840).\n\u2022 County School Facilities Fund The county school facilities fund is established pursuant to Education Code\nSection 17070.43 to receive apportionments from the 1998 State School Facilities Fund (Proposition 1A),\nthe 2002 State School Facilities Fund (Proposition 47), the 2004 State School Facilities Fund (Proposition\n55) or the 2006 State Schools Facilities Fund (Proposition 1D) authorized by the State Allocation Board for\nnew school facility construction, modernization projects, and facility hardship grants, as provided in the\nLeroy F.

The Mello-Roos Community Facilities Act of 1982 (Government Code Section 53311 et seq.) allows\nany county, city, special district, school district, or joint powers authority to establish, upon approval of\ntwo-thirds of the voters in the district, a \u201cCommunity Facilities District\u201d (CFD). This fund reports the\nfinancial activity of the 2010 Proposition A School Facilities Special Tax, the 1990 School Facilities Special\nTax, and ADA capital improvements.\nProprietary Funds Proprietary funds are used to account for activities that are more business-like than\ngovernment-like in nature. The District reports self-insurance related activity in such a fund.\n\u2022 Self-Insurance Internal Service Fund Internal service funds may be used to account for goods or services\nprovided to other funds of the District on a cost-reimbursement basis. The District operates a self-\ninsurance fund for its workers\u2019 compensation, dental, and other post-employment retiree benefits self-\ninsurance programs.\nFiduciary Funds Fiduciary funds are used to account for resources held for the benefit of parties outside the\nDistrict and are not available to support the District\u2019s own programs. Fiduciary funds are split into four\nclassifications: pension trust funds, investment trust funds, private-purpose trust funds, and custodial funds. The\nthree types of trust funds are distinguished from custodial funds by the existence of a trust agreement or\nequivalent arrangement that has certain characteristics.\nTrust funds are used to account for resources held by the District under a trust agreement for individuals,\nprivate organizations, or other governments. Private-purpose trust funds are accounted for as a restricted\ncomponent of the General Fund. Custodial funds are used to account for resources, not in a trust, that are held\nby the District for other parties outside the District\u2019s reporting entity. The District maintains the following\ncustodial fund:\n\u2022 Payroll Revolving Custodial Fund The payroll revolving fund is used to account for assets held for external\ncharter school employees for payroll withholding for subsequent remittance to taxing agencies or benefit\nproviders.\nBasis of Accounting - Measurement Focus\nGovernment-Wide Financial Statements The government-wide statements are prepared using the economic\nresources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting. This is the same approach used in the\npreparation of the proprietary fund financial statements but differs from the manner in which governmental\nfund financial statements are prepared.\n32",
    "36": "San Francisco Unified School District\nNotes to Financial Statements\nJune 30, 2021\nThe government-wide statement of activities presents a comparison between expenses, both direct and\nindirect, of the District and for each governmental function, and excludes fiduciary activity. Direct expenses are\nthose that are specifically associated with a service, program or department and are therefore clearly\nidentifiable to a particular function. Indirect expenses for centralized services and administrative overhead are\nallocated among the programs, functions and segments using a full cost allocation approach and are presented\nseparately to enhance comparability of direct expenses between governments that allocate direct expenses and\nthose that do not. Program revenues include charges paid by the recipients of the goods or services offered by\nthe programs and grants and contributions that are restricted to meeting the operational or capital\nrequirements of a particular program. Revenues that are not classified as program revenues are presented as\ngeneral revenues. The comparison of program revenues and expenses identifies the extent to which each\ngovernmental function is self-financing or draws from the general revenues of the District. Eliminations have\nbeen made to minimize the double counting of internal activities.\nNet position is reported as restricted when constraints are either externally imposed by creditors (such as\nthrough debt covenants), grantors, contributors, or laws or regulations of other governments or imposed by law\nthrough constitutional provisions or enabling legislation.\nFund Financial Statements Fund financial statements report detailed information about the District. The focus\nof governmental fund financial statements is on major funds rather than reporting funds by type. Each major\nfund is presented in a separate column. Nonmajor funds are aggregated and presented in a single column. The\ninternal service fund is presented in a single column.\n\u2022 Governmental Funds All governmental funds are accounted for using a flow of current financial resources\nmeasurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. With this measurement focus, only\ncurrent assets and current liabilities generally are included on the balance sheet. The statement of\nrevenues, expenditures, and changes in fund balances reports on the sources (revenues and other\nfinancing sources) and uses (expenditures and other financing uses) of current financial resources. This\napproach differs from the way the governmental activities of the government-wide statements are\nprepared. Governmental fund financial statements therefore include reconciliations with brief\nexplanations to better identify the relationship between the government-wide statements, prepared on\nthe accrual basis of accounting using the economic resources measurement focus, and the governmental\nfund statements, prepared on the modified accrual basis of accounting and using the flow of current\nfinancial resources measurement focus.\n\u2022 Proprietary Funds Proprietary funds are accounted for using the economic resources measurement focus\nand the accrual basis of accounting. All assets and all liabilities associated with the operation of this fund\nare included in the Statement of Net Position. The Statement of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Fund\nNet Position presents increases (revenues) and decreases (expenses) in net total position. The statement\nof cash flows provides information about how the District finances and meets the cash flow needs of its\nproprietary fund.\n\u2022 Fiduciary Funds Fiduciary funds are accounted for using the economic resources measurement focus and\nthe accrual basis of accounting.\n33",
    "37": "San Francisco Unified School District\nNotes to Financial Statements\nJune 30, 2021\nRevenues - Exchange and Non-exchange Transactions Revenue resulting from exchange transactions, in which\neach party gives and receives essentially equal value, is recorded on the accrual basis when the exchange takes\nplace. On the modified accrual basis, revenue is recorded in the fiscal year in which the resources are\nmeasurable and become available. Available means that the resources will be collected within the current fiscal\nyear or are expected to be collected soon enough thereafter to be used to pay liabilities of the current fiscal\nyear. The District considers revenues to be available if they are collected within one year after year-end. To\nachieve comparability of reporting among California districts and so as not to distort normal revenue patterns,\nwith specific respect to reimbursement grants and corrections to state-aid apportionments, the California\nDepartment of Education has defined available for districts as collectible within one year.\nNon-exchange transactions, in which the District receives value without directly giving equal value in return,\ninclude property taxes, certain grants, entitlements and donations. Revenue from property taxes is recognized in\nthe fiscal year in which the taxes are received. Revenue from certain grants, entitlements and donations is\nrecognized in the fiscal year in which all eligibility requirements have been satisfied. Eligibility requirements\ninclude time and purpose requirements. On the modified accrual basis, revenue from non-exchange transactions\nmust also be available before it can be recognized.\nUnearned Revenue Unearned revenues arise when resources are received by the District before it has a legal\nclaim to them, such as when certain grants are received prior to the occurrence of qualifying expenditures. In\nthe subsequent periods, when the District has a legal claim to the resources, the liability for unearned revenue is\nremoved from the balance sheet and the revenue is recognized.\nExpenses/Expenditures On the accrual basis of accounting, expenses are recognized at the time they are\nincurred. The measurement focus of governmental fund accounting is on decreases in net financial resources\n(expenditures) rather than expenses. Expenditures are generally recognized in the accounting period in which\nthe related fund liability is incurred. However, principal and interest on general long-term liabilities are\nrecognized when paid in the governmental funds. Allocations of costs, such as depreciation and amortization,\nare not recognized in the governmental funds but are recognized in the government-wide statements.\nCash and Deposits\nThe District's cash and deposits are considered to be cash on hand, demand deposits, and short-term\ninvestments with original maturities of three months or less from the date of acquisition. Cash equivalents\ninclude cash with county treasury balances for purposes of the statement of cash flows.\nInvestments\nInvestments are stated at fair value. Fair value is estimated based on quoted market price at year-end.\nInvestments consist of cash deposits with the City and County of San Francisco Treasury Investment Pool.\n34",

Such constraints are either imposed by creditors, contributors, grantors, or laws of other governments or\nimposed by enabling legislation.\nPrepaid Expenditures (Expenses)\nCertain payments to vendors reflect costs applicable to future accounting periods and are recorded as prepaid\nitems in both the government-wide and fund financial statements. The cost of prepaid items is recorded as\nexpenditures/expenses when consumed rather than when purchased.\nStores Inventories\nInventories consist of expendable food and supplies held for consumption. Inventories are stated at cost on\nweighted average basis. The cost of using inventory items is recorded as expenditures when used in the\ngovernmental funds.\nCapital Assets and Depreciation\nThe accounting and reporting treatment applied to the capital assets associated with a fund are determined by\nits measurement focus. Capital assets are long-lived assets of the District as a whole. The District maintains a\ncapitalization threshold of $25,000. The District does not possess any infrastructure. Improvements are\ncapitalized; the costs of normal maintenance and repairs that do not add to the value of the asset or materially\nextend an asset's life are not capitalized but are expensed as incurred.\nWhen purchased, such assets are recorded as expenditures in the governmental funds and capitalized in the\ngovernment-wide statement of net position. The valuation basis for capital assets is historical cost, or where\nhistorical cost is not available, estimated historical cost based on replacement cost. Donated capital assets are\ncapitalized at acquisition value on the date donated.\nDepreciation is computed using the straight-line method. Estimated useful lives of the various classes of\ndepreciable capital assets are as follows: buildings, 20 to 50 years; improvements/infrastructure, 5 to 50 years;\nequipment, 2 to 15 years.\nCompensated Absences\nFull-time District employees are entitled to 10-20 vacation days a year, depending upon length of service, for\nwhich up to 30 working days in excess of the employee\u2019s annual vacation award may be carried over to the next\nyear. Compensated absences are accrued as a liability as the benefits are earned. The entire compensated\nabsence liability is reported on the government-wide statement of net position. For governmental funds, the\ncurrent portion of unpaid compensated absences is recognized upon the occurrence of relevant events such as\nemployee resignations and retirements that occur prior to year end that have not yet been paid with\nexpendable available financial resources. The amounts are reported in the fund from which the employees who\nhave accumulated leave are paid.\n35",

In general, governmental fund payables and accrued liabilities that, once incurred, are paid in a\ntimely manner and in full from current financial resources are reported as obligations of the funds.\nHowever, claims and judgments compensated absences, special termination benefits and contractually required\npension contributions that will be paid from governmental funds are reported as a liability in the fund financial\nstatements only to the extent that they are due for payment during the current year. Long-term liabilities are\nnot recognized as liabilities in governmental funds but are disclosed in the notes to financial statements. Debt\nservice expenditures, including principal and interest on bonds and capital leases, are recognized as\nexpenditures in governmental funds when paid.\nCurrent Loans\nCurrent loans consist of amounts outstanding at year end for Tax Revenue and Anticipation Notes, The notes\nwere issued as short-term liabilities to provide cash flow needs.

Debt premiums and discounts, as well as issuance costs related to\nprepaid insurance costs are amortized over the life of the bonds using the straight-line method, which\napproximates the effective interest method.\nIn governmental fund financial statements, bond premiums and discounts, as well as debt issuance costs are\nrecognized in the period the bonds are issued. The face amount of the debt is reported as other financing\nsources. Premiums received on debt issuance are also reported as other financing sources. Issuance costs,\nwhether or not withheld from the actual debt proceeds, are reported as debt service expenditures in the period\nthe bonds are issued.\nDeferred Outflows/Inflows of Resources\nIn addition to assets, the Statement of Net Position also reports deferred outflows of resources. This separate\nfinancial statement element represents a consumption of net position that applies to a future period and so will\nnot be recognized as an expense or expenditure until then. The District reports deferred outflows of resources\nfor deferred charges on refunding of debt, for pension related items, and for OPEB related items. The deferred\ncharge on refunding resulted from the difference between the carrying value of the refunded debt and its\nreacquisition price. The amount is deferred and amortized over the shorter of the life of the refunded or\nrefunding debt. The deferred amounts related to pension and OPEB relate to differences between expected and\nactual earnings on investments, changes of assumptions, and other pension and OPEB related changes.\nIn addition to liabilities, the Statement of Net Position reports a separate section for deferred inflows of\nresources. This separate financial statement element represents an acquisition of net position that applies to a\nfuture period and so will not be recognized as revenue until then. The District reports deferred inflows of\nresources for deferred charges on refunding of debt, for pension related items, and for OPEB related items.\nPensions\nFor purposes of measuring the net pension liability and deferred outflows and inflows of resources related to\npensions, and pension expense, information about the fiduciary net position of the California State Teachers'\nRetirement System (CalSTRS) and the San Francisco Public Employees' Retirement System (SFERS) and additions\nto/deductions from the plans' fiduciary net position have been determined on the same basis as they are\nreported by CalSTRS and SFERS. For this purpose, benefit payments (including refunds of employee\ncontributions) are recognized when due and payable in accordance with the benefit terms. Member\ncontributions are recognized in the period in which they are earned. Investments are reported at fair value.

The total OPEB liability attributable to the\ngovernmental activities will be paid primarily by the General Fund.\nFund Balances - Governmental Funds\nAs of June 30, 2021, fund balances of the governmental funds are classified as follows:\nNonspendable - amounts that cannot be spent either because they are in nonspendable form or because they\nare legally or contractually required to be maintained intact.\nRestricted - amounts that can be spent only for specific purposes because of constitutional provisions or\nenabling legislation or because of constraints that are externally imposed by creditors, grantors, contributors, or\nthe laws or regulations of other governments.\nCommitted - amounts that can be used only for specific purposes determined by a formal action of the Board of\nEducation. The Board of Education is the highest level of decision-making authority for the District.\nCommitments may be established, modified, or rescinded only through resolutions or other action as approved\nby the governing board.\nAssigned - amounts that do not meet the criteria to be classified as restricted or committed but that are\nintended to be used for specific purposes. Under the District's policy, only the governing board or chief financial\nofficer or designee, may assign amounts for specific purposes.\nUnassigned - all other spendable amounts.\nSpending Order Policy\nWhen an expenditure is incurred for purposes for which both restricted and unrestricted fund balance is\navailable, the District considers restricted funds to have been spent first. When an expenditure is incurred for\nwhich assigned or unassigned fund balances are available, the District considers amounts to have been spent\nfirst out of the assigned funds, and finally unassigned funds, as needed, unless the governing board has provided\notherwise in its commitment or assignment actions.\n38",

Net position net of investment in capital assets consists of capital assets, net of\naccumulated depreciation, reduced by the outstanding balances of any borrowings used for the acquisition,\nconstruction, or improvement of those assets. Net position is reported as restricted when there are limitations\nimposed on their use either through the enabling legislation adopted by the District or through external\nrestrictions imposed by creditors, grantors, or laws or regulations of other governments.\nOperating Revenues and Expenses\nOperating revenues are those revenues that are generated directly from the primary activity of the proprietary\nfunds. For the District, these revenues are in-district insurance premiums. Operating expenses are necessary\ncosts incurred to provide the good or service that is the primary activity of the fund. All revenues and expenses\nnot meeting this definition are reported as nonoperating revenues and expenses.\nlnterfund Activity\nExchange transactions between funds are reported as revenues in the seller funds and as\nexpenditures/expenses in the purchaser funds. Flows of cash or goods from one fund to another without a\nrequirement for repayment are reported as interfund transfers. Interfund transfers are reported as other\nfinancing sources/uses in governmental funds and after non-operating revenues/expenses in proprietary funds.\nRepayments from funds responsible for particular expenditures/expenses to the funds that initially paid for\nthem are not presented on the financial statements.\nEstimates\nThe preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the\nfinancial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\nBudgetary Data\nThe budgetary process is prescribed by provisions of the California Education Code and requires the governing\nboard to hold a public hearing and adopt an operating budget no later than July 1 of each year. The District\ngoverning board satisfied these requirements. The adopted budget is subject to amendment throughout the\nyear to give consideration to unanticipated revenue and expenditures primarily resulting from events unknown\nat the time of budget adoption with the legal restriction that expenditures cannot exceed appropriations by\nmajor object account.\nThe amounts reported as the original budgeted amounts in the budgetary statements reflect the amounts when\nthe original appropriations were adopted.

This Statement increases the usefulness of governments\u2019 financial\nstatements by requiring recognition of certain lease assets and liabilities for leases that previously were\nclassified as operating leases and recognized as inflows of resources or outflows of resources based on the\npayment provisions of the contract. It establishes a single model for lease accounting based on the foundational\nprinciple that leases are financings of the right to use an underlying asset. Under this Statement, a lessee is\nrequired to recognize a lease liability and an intangible right-to-use lease asset, and a lessor is required to\nrecognize a lease receivable and a deferred inflow of resources, thereby enhancing the relevance and\nconsistency of information about govern-ments\u2019 leasing activities.

    "47": "San Francisco Unified School District\nNotes to Financial Statements\nJune 30, 2021\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates will adversely affect the fair value of an\ninvestment. Generally, the longer the maturity of an investment the greater the sensitivity of its fair value to\nchanges in market interest rates. The District manages its exposure to interest rate risk by investing in the City\nand County of San Francisco Treasury Investment Pool. The sensitivity of the fair values of the District's\ninvestments to market interest rate fluctuation is measured as the weighted average maturity of the investment\nportfolio, which was 561 days on June 30, 2021.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is the risk that an issuer of an investment will not fulfill its obligation to the holder of the investment.\nThis is measured by the assignment of a rating by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. The\nDistrict's investment in the county pool is not rated as of June 30, 2021.\nCustodial Credit Risk - Deposits\nCustodial credit risk for deposits is the risk that, in the event of the failure of a depository financial institution, a\ngovernment will not be able to recover its deposits or will not be able to recover collateral securities that are in\nthe possession of an outside party. The California Government Code and the District\u2019s investment policy do not\ncontain legal or policy requirements that would limit the exposure to custodial credit risk for deposits other than\nthe following provision: the California Government Code requires that a financial institution secure deposits\nmade by state or local governmental units by pledging securities in an undivided collateral pool held by a\ndepository regulated under state law (unless so waived by the governmental unit). The market value of the\npledged securities in the collateral pool must equal at least 110% of the total amount deposited by the public\nagencies. California law also allows financial institutions to secure deposits by pledging first trust deed mortgage\nnotes having a value of 150% of the secured public deposits.\nAs of June 30, 2021, the District\u2019s bank balance of $6.8 million was exposed to custodial credit risk because it\nwas uninsured and collateralized with securities held by the pledging financial institution\u2019s trust department or\nagent, but not in the name of the District.\n44",

The following provides a summary of the hierarchy used\nto measure fair value:\n\u2022 Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets that the District has the ability to access at the\nmeasurement date.\n\u2022 Level 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets in active\nmarkets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active.\n\u2022 Level 3 - Unobservable inputs should be developed using the best information available under the\ncircumstances, which might include the District's own data.\nUncategorized - Deposits and withdrawals in the City and County of San Francisco Treasury Investment Pool are\nmade on the basis of $1 and not fair value.

    "70": "San Francisco Unified School District\nNotes to Financial Statements\nJune 30, 2021\nThe long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined using a building-block\nmethod in which best estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return (expected returns, net of pension\nplan investment expense and inflation) are developed for each major asset class. The best estimate ranges were\ndeveloped using capital market assumptions from CalSTRS general investment consultant (Pension Consulting\nAlliance-PCA) as an input to the process. The actuarial investment rate of return assumption was adopted by the\nboard in January 2020 in conjunction with the most recent experience study. For each future valuation, CalSTRS\nconsulting actuary (Milliman) reviews the return assumption for reasonableness based on the most current\ncapital market assumptions. Best estimates of 20-year geometrically-linked real rates of return and the assumed\nasset allocation for each major asset class for the year ended June 30, 2020, are summarized in the following\ntable:\nLong-Term\nAssumed Asset Expected Real\nAsset Class Allocation Rate of Return\nGlobal equity 42% 4.80%\nFixed income 12% 1.30%\nReal estate 15% 3.60%\nPrivate equity 13% 6.30%\nRisk Mitigating Strategies 10% 1.80%\nInflation sensitive 6% -3.30%\nCash/liquidity 2% -0.40%\n100%\nDiscount Rate\nThe discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 7.10 percent. The projection of cash flows used\nto determine the discount rate assumed the contributions from plan members and employers will be made at\nstatutory contribution rates. Projected inflows from investment earnings were calculated using the long-term\nassumed investment rate of return (7.10 percent) and assuming that contributions, benefit payments and\nadministrative expense occurred midyear. Based on these assumptions, the STRP's fiduciary net position was\nprojected to be available to make all projected future benefit payments to current plan members. Therefore, the\nlong-term assumed investment rate of return was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to\ndetermine total pension liability.\nThe following presents the District's proportionate share of the net pension liability calculated using the current\ndiscount rate as well as what the net pension liability would be if it were calculated using a discount rate that is\none percent lower or higher than the current rate:\nNet Pension\nDiscount Rate Liability\n1% decrease (6.10%) $ 1,165,320,339\nCurrent discount rate (7.10%) 771,295,683\n67",

SFERS is a separate department of the City, deriving its powers, functions, and\nresponsibility from the City Charter and ordinances of the Board of Supervisors of the City. Substantially all\nemployees of the City and County are members, including most of the District\u2019s classified permanent full-time\nemployees and certain certificated employees hired prior to July 1, 1972. Members are classified according to\nCity bargaining units as police, fire, and miscellaneous. District employees are members of the miscellaneous\npool. SFERS issues a separate annual financial report that includes financial statements and required\nsupplementary information. The SFERS annual financial report is available online at www.sfers.org.\nBenefits Provided\nThe retirement system provides service retirement, disability, and death benefits based on specified\npercentages of defined final average monthly salary and annual cost-of-living adjustments after retirement.\nEmployees with 20 years of service who have attained age 50 or those with 10 years of service who have\nattained age 60 are eligible for retirement benefits. The City Charter and the Administrative Code are the\nauthorities that establish and amend the benefit provisions of the plan and employer and member obligations to\nthe plan.\nThe membership groups and the related service retirement benefits are included in the notes to the basic\nfinancial statements of the retirement system, which are available on the SFERS website.\nAll retired members receive a benefit adjustment each July 1, which is the basic cost of living adjustment (COLA).\nThe majority of adjustments are determined by changes in the Consumer Price Index with increases capped at\n2%. The Plan provides for a supplemental COLA in years when there are sufficient \u201cexcess\u201d investment earnings\nin the Plan and the Plan is fully funded on a market value of assets basis. The maximum benefit adjustment is\n3.5% including that Basic COLA. For members hired on or after January 7, 2012, supplemental COLAs will not be\npermanent adjustments to retirement benefits.\nContributions\nContributions are made to the plan by both the employers and the participating employees. The basic employer\ncontributions are the amounts deemed necessary, on an actuarial basis using the entry age normal cost method,\nto provide the plan with assets sufficient to pay the basic benefits that are not provided for by employees\u2019\ncontributions. Employee and employer contributions are mandatory, as required by the City Charter. The\nDistrict's contributions to SFERS, for the year ended June 30, 2021 were $25.1 million. Employee contribution\nrates for fiscal year 2020-2021 varied from 7.5% to 12.0% as a percentage of gross covered salary. The District is\nrequired to contribute at an actuarially determined rate. Based on the July 1, 2019 actuarial report, the required\nemployer contribution rate for fiscal year 2020-2021 was 26.9%.\n68",

Projected benefit payments are discounted at the long-term expected\nreturn on assets of 7.40% to the extent the fiduciary net position is available to make the payments and at the\nmunicipal bond rate of 2.21% to the extent they are not available. Since the payments discounted at the\nmunicipal bond rate are relatively few and far in the future, the municipal bond rate does not affect the single\nequivalent rate when rounded to two decimal places. Consequently, the single equivalent rate used to\ndetermine the total pension liability as of June 30, 2020 is 7.40%.\nThe long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was 7.40%. It was set by the Retirement\nBoard after consideration of both expected future returns and historical returns experienced by the by the\nRetirement System. Expected future returns were determined by using a building-block method in which best-\nestimate ranges of expected future real rates of return were developed for each major asset class.

The San Francisco Unified\nSchool District was established in 1851. The District is governed by an elected Board of seven members. The\nDistrict also administers the County Office of Education.\nThe District and County Office of Education provide pre-kindergarten, transitional kindergarten, kindergarten,\nelementary, middle and secondary education in the City and County of San Francisco through a network of 136\nschools as follows:\n12 early education schools\n64 elementary schools (TK-5)\n8 alternatively configured schools (TK-8)\n13 middle schools (6-8)\n14 high schools (9-12)\n3 continuation/alternative schools, including an independent study school\n8 court and county community schools and programs\n14 district-authorized charter schools\nThe majority of the District\u2019s elementary schools have designated attendance areas giving priority to students\nliving within those attendance boundaries. The remaining elementary schools are \u201cCity-wide schools\u201d with no\ndesignated attendance area. Each middle school is linked to several elementary schools through feeder patterns;\nhowever, all SFUSD schools enroll students based on parent/guardian request and provide significant\nopportunities for parental choice in enrollment.\nThe District is also the chartering entity and has oversight responsibility for fourteen charter schools: City Arts\nand Technology High School, Creative Arts Charter School, Five Keys Charter School, Five Keys Adult School, Five\nKeys Independence High School, Gateway High School, Gateway Middle School, KIPP Bayview Academy, KIPP\nSan Francisco Bay Academy, KIPP San Francisco College Preparatory, Leadership High School, Life Learning\nAcademy, Thomas Edison Charter Academy and Mission Preparatory.\nThe District\u2019s diverse student demographics includes 33% Asian, 30% Latino, 14% White, 5% African American,\n4% Filipino, 1% Pacific Islander and 13% \u201cOther\u201d. Approximately 27% of the student population is designated as\nEnglish Language Learners, 13% Special Education, and 53% is Free- and Reduced-Price eligible. This diverse\npopulation enriches SFUSD and calls for focused investments to support varying socioeconomic and learning\nneeds of its students.\nStrategic Planning\nSFUSD began a deliberate course of action in 2008 with its strategic plan, Beyond the Talk: Taking Action to\nEducate Every Child Now. Beyond the Talk represented our community\u2019s bold aspirational goals that have\nremained unchanged, while we continue our deep and unrelenting commitment to our three District goals:\nAccess and Equity \u2013 Make social justice a reality by ensuring every student has access to high quality\nteaching and learning.\n4",

In his first year as\nSuperintendent, Dr. Wayne has collaborated with the Board of Education to begin a process to reaffirm and\nupdate our District Vision, Values, Goals, Guardrails, as well as initiate a community engagement process to\ngather feedback on these goals. Moving forward, SFUSD will focus on 3 goals: 3rd Grade Literacy, 8th Grade\nMath, and College and Career Readiness.\nSFUSD students experienced disruptions in learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, which are reflected in\nSmarter Balanced Assessments in English Language Arts and Math; however, results show SFUSD students\nremaining ahead of their peers in California and in most large urban school districts. English Language Arts\nscores are down from 55% to 54% of District students meeting or exceeding standards but remain higher than\nthe state average of 47%. In Math, the percentage of students who meet or exceed grade level standards as\nmeasured by the Smarter Balanced Assessment decreased from 69% in school year 2020-21 to 46% in school\nyear 2021-22 but remains ahead of the state average of 33%.\nThe graduation rate for San Francisco Unified School District rose to 90.4% in 2021-22, compared to 88.3% in\n2020-21 and 87% statewide.\n5",
    "9": "San Francisco Unified School District\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nJune 30, 2022\nLocal Funding Sources\nSecuring local revenues has been a critical strategy for helping the District meet its goals, by increasing resources\nfor students and providing competitive salaries and professional development opportunities in order to recruit\nand retain high quality educators.\nFirst, in June 2008, Proposition A, the Quality Teacher & Education Act (\u201cQTEA\u201d), was passed by the voters of\nSan Francisco to deliver over $40 million annually to the District for the next twenty years, through fiscal year\n2028-29. These resources assist in recruiting and retaining effective teachers, supporting innovative instructional\nstrategies, increasing accountability, and improving the District\u2019s technology infrastructure. The District received\n$45.5 million of QTEA funding in FY 2021-22.\nAdditionally, the Public Education Enrichment Fund (PEEF), was approved by the voters of San Francisco in\nMarch, 2004, and re-established in 2014. The district receives two-thirds of the annual PEEF allocation from the\nCity with the remaining one-third going to the City\u2019s Department of Early Care and Education for support to\npreschool. The district\u2019s portion of PEEF is used to support sports, libraries, the arts and music (SLAM) as well as\nprograms such as Wellness Centers, Student Support Professionals at schools, Translation Services, STEAM\ncurriculum, and Peer Resources, to name a few. The District received $84.4 million of PEEF revenue in 2021-22.\nFinally, the Living Wage for Educators Act (LWEA) parcel tax measure was passed by voters in 2018 with a 61%\nvote. In 2020, LWEA was replaced by the Fair Wages for Educators Act (FWEA) to secure a 74% voter approval\nand generate over $48 million annually through to fiscal year 2038. Both LWEA and FWEA support targeted\nincreases to educator salaries and professional development.\nFinancial Highlights\nBudgeting\nThe SFUSD adopted budget is developed based on the latest information on revenue projections received from\nthe Governor\u2019s May revision to the state budget, which is typically released a few months before the final State\nbudget is passed. The District held budget hearings and adopted the FY 2021-22 budget in accordance with\nprovisions of the California Education Code. The budget reflects the District\u2019s goals to emphasize the\nachievement of all students and to narrow the achievement gap for our African-American students. Throughout\nthe budget development process, staff is encouraged to work with the community to develop sound decisions\nthat support the needs of all students.\n6",
    "10": "San Francisco Unified School District\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nJune 30, 2022\nOnly grants that the District is certain of receiving are included in the adopted budget. Additional programs are\nbudgeted as grant awards are received during the course of the year. Grants are budgeted to be fully expended.\nCarryover funds are budgeted when carryover balances are determined and per instructions from program\nmanagers. As program needs change during the year, changes and revisions to the adopted budget are made\nthroughout the year to reflect these changes. Budget transfers and budget revisions are made on an ongoing\nbasis, and new programs are budgeted throughout the fiscal year. We have included a budgetary comparison\nschedule on page 70 providing the adopted and final budgets compared with actual revenues and expenditures.\nUnrestricted General Fund Results of Operations\nDuring fiscal year 2021-22, the District\u2019s unrestricted general fund ending balance, which includes\nnonspendable, and unassigned balances, increased from $42.8 million to $136.0 million, a $93 million or 218%\nincrease due to the receipt of nonrecurring Federal grants and deliberate efforts to increase budget stabilization\nreserves to help address anticipated future year deficits.\nCompared to the previous fiscal year, unrestricted general fund revenues were $733.8 million, an increase of\n$130.7 million, or 17.19%, and unrestricted general fund expenditures and transfers out were $615.4 million, an\nincrease of $45.2 million or 7.9%, excluding the effects of GASB 87, Leases for comparability. This is due\nprimarily to operating savings that resulted from the pandemic, increase in employee salaries negotiated under\na new three-year contract that became effective as of the start of the fiscal year as well as increases in the\nCALSTRS retirement contribution rate. Total salaries decreased by 9.5% to $276.1 million from $305.6 million the\nprevious year, while the employer contribution rate for teachers\u2019 retirement rose from 17.1% of certificated\npayroll to 20.3% of certificated payroll, a 3.15% increase.\nThe general fund contributed to the child development program (Fund 12), the cafeteria program (Fund 13),\nand the deferred maintenance fund (Fund 14). Transfers to other funds in the amount of $17.7 million are $1.9\nmillion or 12% higher than 2021-22 levels due to an end of year balance in the 81500 Maintenance Reserve in\nFund 01 resulting from operating savings during the pandemic that should be used to address deferred\nmaintenance needs.\nGeneral Fund Ending Balance and Reserves\nThe District\u2019s general fund ending balance on June 30, 2022 was $293.0 million. The restricted portion of $115.0\nmillion will broadly be used for instructional activities, although its use is restricted for specific program\nactivities and cannot be counted as available (unrestricted reserves).

    "12": "San Francisco Unified School District\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nJune 30, 2022\nOverview of the Financial Statements\nThis annual report consists of three parts \u2013 management\u2019s discussion and analysis (this section), the basic\nfinancial statements, and required supplementary information. The basic financial statements include two kinds\nof statements that present different views of the District:\n\u2022 The first two statements are government-wide financial statements that provide both short-term and\nlong-term information about the District\u2019s overall financial status.\n\u2022 The remaining statements are fund financial statements that focus on individual parts of the District,\nreporting the District\u2019s operations in more detail than the government-wide statements.\n\u2022 The governmental funds statements tell how basic services like regular and special education were\nfinanced in the short term as well as what remains for future spending.\n\u2022 Proprietary fund statements offer financial information about the activities the District operates on a cost\nreimbursement basis, such as the Self-insurance Fund.\n\u2022 Fiduciary funds statements provide information about the financial relationships in which the District acts\nsolely as a trustee or agent for the benefit of others to whom the resources belong. Fiduciary fund activity\nis excluded from the government-wide financial statements.\nThe financial statements also include notes that explain some of the information in the statements and provide\nmore detailed data. The statements are followed by a section of required supplementary information that\nfurther explains and supports the financial statements with comparisons of the District\u2019s General and County\nSchool Service Fund budgets, both the adopted and final version, with year-end actuals.\nGovernment-Wide Statements\nThe government-wide statements report information about the District as a whole using accounting methods\nsimilar to those used by private-sector companies. The statement of net position includes all of the District\u2019s\nassets and liabilities. All of the current year\u2019s revenues and expenses are accounted for in the statement of\nactivities regardless of when cash is received or paid.\nThe two government-wide statements report the District\u2019s net position and how they have changed. Net\nposition \u2013 the difference between assets and liabilities \u2013 is one way to measure the District\u2019s financial health.\n\u2022 Over time, increases or decreases in the District\u2019s net position may be an indicator of whether its financial\nposition is improving or deteriorating, respectively.\n\u2022 To assess the overall health of the District one needs to consider additional non-financial factors such as\nchanges in the District\u2019s property tax base, its student enrollment data, the State\u2019s fiscal health and the\ncondition of school buildings and other facilities.\n9",
    "13": "San Francisco Unified School District\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nJune 30, 2022\nFund Financial Statements\nThe fund financial statements provide more detailed information about the District\u2019s most significant funds \u2013\nnot the District as a whole. Funds are accounting devices the District uses to keep track of specific sources of\nfunding and spending on particular programs:\n\u2022 Some funds are required by State law and by bond covenants.\n\u2022 The District establishes other funds to control and manage money for particular purposes (such as\npayment of long-term debt) or to show that it is properly using certain revenues (such as Federal grants).\nThe District has three kinds of funds:\n\u2022 Governmental funds \u2013 Most of the District\u2019s basic services are included in governmental funds, which\ngenerally focus on (1) how cash and other financial assets that can readily be converted to cash flow in\nand out and (2) the balances left at year-end that are available for spending. Consequently, the\ngovernmental funds statements provide a detailed short-term view that helps one determine whether\nthere are more or fewer financial resources that can be spent in the near future to finance the District\u2019s\nprograms. Because this information does not encompass the additional long-term focus of the district-\nwide statements, reconciliations between the district-wide statements and the fund financial statements\nare provided.\n\u2022 Proprietary funds \u2013 Services for which the District charges a fee are generally reported in proprietary\nfunds. The District uses one internal service fund \u2013 the self-insurance fund \u2013 to account for and report\nactivities related to the self-insured workers compensation program.\n\u2022 Fiduciary funds \u2013 The District holds assets in a custodial capacity that belong to external entities such as\ncharter schools. The District is responsible for remitting the payroll withholding to benefit providers and\ntaxing authorities on behalf of these external entities. All of the District\u2019s fiduciary activities are reported\nin a separate statement of fiduciary net position. These activities are excluded from the district-wide\nfinancial statements because they cannot be used to finance operations.\n10",
    "14": "San Francisco Unified School District\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nJune 30, 2022\nReporting the District as A Whole\nThe Statement of Net Position and the Statement of Activities\nThe statement of net position and the statement of activities report information about the District as a whole\nand about its activities. These statements include all assets and liabilities of the District using the accrual basis of\naccounting, which is similar to the accounting used by most private-sector companies. All of the current year's\nrevenues and expenses are taken into account regardless of when cash is received or paid.\nThese two statements report the District's net position and changes in them. Net position is the difference\nbetween assets and deferred outflows of resources, and liabilities and deferred inflows of resources, which is\none way to measure the District's financial health, or financial position. Over time, increases or decreases in the\nDistrict's net position will serve as a useful indicator of whether the financial position of the District is improving\nor deteriorating. Other factors to consider are changes in the District's property tax base and the condition of\nthe District's facilities.\nThe relationship between revenues and expenses is the District's operating results. Since the governing board's\nresponsibility is to provide services to our students and not to generate profit as commercial entities do, one\nmust consider other factors when evaluating the overall health of the District. The quality of the education and\nthe safety of our schools will likely be an important component in this evaluation.\nThe statement of net position and the statement of activities report all of the District\u2019s financial activity as in\nsupport of \u201cgovernmental activities.\u201d Governmental activities include the education of kindergarten through\ngrade twelve students, county office of education programs, the operation of child development activities, and\nthe on-going effort to improve and maintain buildings and sites. Property taxes, state income taxes, user fees,\ninterest income, federal, state, and local grants, as well as general obligation bonds, finance these activities.\nReporting the District's Most Significant Funds\nFund Financial Statements\nThe fund financial statements provide detailed information about the most significant funds - not the District as\na whole. Some funds are required to be established by state law and by bond covenants. However, management\nestablishes many other funds to help it control and manage money for particular purposes or to show that it is\nmeeting legal responsibilities for using certain taxes, grants, and other money that it receives from the\nU.S. Department of Education.\n11",
    "15": "San Francisco Unified School District\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nJune 30, 2022\nGovernmental Funds\nMost of the District's basic services are reported in governmental funds, which focus on how money flows into\nand out of those funds and the balances left at year-end that are available for spending. These funds are\nreported using an accounting method called modified accrual accounting, which measures cash and all other\nfinancial assets that can readily be converted to cash. The governmental fund statements provide a detailed\nshort-term view of the District's general government operations and the basic services it provides.\nGovernmental fund information helps determine whether there are more or fewer financial resources that can\nbe spent in the near future to finance the District's programs. The differences of results in the governmental\nfund financial statements to those in the government-wide financial statements are explained in a reconciliation\nfollowing the governmental fund financial statements.\nProprietary Funds\nWe use an internal service fund (a component of proprietary funds) to report activities that provide supplies and\nservices for the District's other programs and activities, such as the District's self-insured workers compensation\nprogram. This activity is reported with governmental activities in the government-wide financial statements.\nThe District as A Trustee\nReporting the District\u2019s Fiduciary Responsibilities\nThe District is the trustee, or fiduciary, for funds held on behalf of external entities. We exclude these activities\nfrom the District's other financial statements because the District cannot use these assets to finance its\noperations. The District is responsible for ensuring that the assets reported in these funds are used for their\nintended purposes.\nCapital Assets and Debt Administration\nFor financial accounting purposes, capital assets are valued at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and\nare not intended to present an estimate of fair market value. At the close of the year ended June 30, 2022, the\nDistrict\u2019s capital assets totaled $2.8 billion. Accumulated depreciation was $832.5 million at year end.\nDepreciation expense for the year totaled $67.6 million. Net book value (the amount of total assets after\napplying depreciation) increased by $48.6 million to $2.0 billion.\n12",

Complete information regarding OPEB and pension is described in\nthe notes to the basic financial statements.\nFinancial Analysis of the District as A Whole\nNet Position\nThe District\u2019s net position on June 30, 2022 was $51.9 million. Of this amount, $1.1 billion represents our net\ninvestment in capital assets, while $247.6 million is restricted for various purposes. The deficit unrestricted net\nposition of $1.3 billion includes our net pension liability and the postemployment benefits obligation.\nFactors Bearing on the District\u2019s Financial Future\nThe District\u2019s financial outlook relies heavily upon its ability to address its structural budget deficit, restore\nreserves, and address its long-term pensions and retiree benefits liabilities, all amidst the challenges of ongoing\nrecovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and the launch of a new, complex employee information and payroll\nsystem (\u201cEMPowerSF\u201d).\n13",
    "17": "San Francisco Unified School District\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nJune 30, 2022\nBudget Stabilization\nEven before the pandemic began, SFUSD faced a structural budget deficit. For several years the District drew\ndown its reserves as revenue growth failed to keep up with the growing cost of running the seventh largest\nschool district in the one of the costliest, yet high poverty cities in the state. Over that time, the District aimed to\ncontrol costs by carving back at its Central Office, yet in FY 2019-20 it was clear that deeper reductions would be\nrequired to stabilize the budget. Then, with school closures and the rollout of distance learning to address the\nspread of COVID-19 in San Francisco as well as across the state and country, SFUSD was forced to address the\neducational crisis of our century with constrained resources.\nThe availability of federal stimulus funds and one-time state resources allowed the District to balance its budget\nand address new pandemic-driven costs between FY 2020-21 and FY 2021-22. In FY 2020-21, federal stimulus\nfunding and the dedication of state funding helped SFUSD address the bulk of its $57 million budget deficit.\nAgain, in FY 2021-22, a total of $119 million federal stimulus funding was used to address a budget deficit of\n$100.2 million, allowing SFUSD to welcome all students back to more stable in-person classrooms and maintain\na reserve to address unforeseen expenses related to the pandemic. By avoiding destabilizing budget cuts to\ndate, SFUSD has been able to provide social-emotional and learning recovery support as students transition back\nfrom distance learning, possible learning loss, social isolation, and other hardships. However, due to the one-\ntime nature of the federal stimulus funds to address prior year deficits, the District still must address a major\nstructural deficit, including projected budget shortfalls of $125 million in FY 2022-23 and $143 million in FY\n2023-24.\nIn its September 15, 2021 letter to the District\u2019s Superintendent, the California Department of Education (CDE)\ndirected SFUSD to develop a balancing plan by December 2021 and submit a balanced budget by July 1, 2022.\nAdditionally, CDE assigned two fiscal experts to help guide the District through the budget balancing process.\nSFUSD responded to these directives by implementing a Zero-Based Budget process in the Fall of 2021 that\naimed to prioritize District spending in three categories: Core Services, District Priorities, and Service\nEnhancements. Budget reductions aimed to scale back Service Enhancements, identify ways to configure the\ndelivery of Core and Priority services more efficiently, and preserve high leverage and high impact investments.\nStaff engaged with school site leaders, labor partners, parent groups, and other stakeholders who will offer\nvaluable perspectives that inform our strategies. By organizing the budget processes in this way, all effort was\nmade to minimize harm to students as a result of budget cuts.\nThe Board of Education ultimately approved a FY 2022-23 and 2023-24 Budget Balancing Plan that included $49\nmillion of expenditures reductions and $76 million new one-time and ongoing funding sources. As the District\ncontinues to address its structural deficit and contend with declining enrollment, it is critical that the use of one-\ntime sources is limited and expenditures are reduced to align with student enrollment and projected ongoing\nrevenues.\n14",
    "18": "San Francisco Unified School District\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nJune 30, 2022\nReserves and Liabilities\nRestoring District reserves and addressing long term liabilities are also critical for building a path towards fiscal\nstability and sustainability. Otherwise, SFUSD will continue to be vulnerable to unforeseen economic conditions,\nsuch as the economic recession driven by COVID-19, and its balance sheet will further decline as liabilities grow\nover time. For example, SFUSD currently pays approximately $37 million annually for existing retirees and holds\na $1.0 billion unfunded liability for future retirees. If no significant investments are made to pre-fund the cost of\nretiree benefits, in 10 years (2031) the annual cost for current employees will far surpass $50 million and the\noverall liability will grow to an estimated $1.9 billion.\nThe District\u2019s success in a lawsuit in opposition to the Proposition G-Living Wages for Educators Act (\u201cLWEA\u201d)\nparcel tax is a critical turning point for addressing its reserve and liabilities. Between 2018 and 2021, $50 million\nwas withheld from SFUSD annually, totaling $150 million. Rather than halt salary increases promised under\nLWEA, the District reduced planned expenditures to $40.0 million per year and funded the $120.0 million total\nexpenses with a $26.6 million loan from the City and $93.4 million from the District\u2019s Rainy Day Reserve. As a\nresult of prevailing in the lawsuit, SFUSD received a $123.4 million payment of parcel tax revenue. Of these\nfunds, $30.0 million must be used for LWEA-eligible expenses and $93.4 million reimburses the District for prior\nLWEA-eligible expenses and may be used for other priority purposes. The San Francisco Board of Education has\nexpressed the intent to use the funds to restore $40 million to a Rainy Day Reserve and use $60 million to pre-\nfund OPEB.\nOther Factors\nAs it relates to future State Budgets, the District\u2019s ability to predict what actions will be taken in the future by\nthe State Legislature and Governor to address the State\u2019s current or future budget and cash management\npractices is limited. Future State budgets will be affected by national and state economic conditions and other\nfactors over which the District has no control. Prospects for State funding are stable due to a sustained\nimprovement in California\u2019s economy and the implementation of the Local Control Funding Formula which has\nprovided increased funds to K-14 education under the Governor\u2019s budget. The State\u2019s approach to declining\nenrollment will impact SFUSD and other districts statewide.\nThe District\u2019s Superintendent and senior staff members will continue to work very closely with the Board of\nEducation to monitor revenues and manage expenditures. SFUSD is fully committed to take whatever measures\nare necessary to maintain a strong and stable financial position. At the same time, the District will also continue\nits dedicated mission to ensure improvement in academic achievement, closing achievement gaps, improving its\nfacilities, and meeting the priorities of the Board of Education and the San Francisco community. It is the\nDistrict\u2019s goal to ensure that all children receive a quality education and a positive foundation necessary for\nthem to achieve academic success and to prepare them for success in the twenty-first century.\n15",

    "33": "San Francisco Unified School District\nNotes to Financial Statements (Unaudited)\nJune 30, 2022\nBasis of Presentation - Fund Accounting\nThe accounting system is organized and operated on a fund basis. A fund is defined as a fiscal and accounting\nentity with a self-balancing set of accounts, which are segregated for the purpose of carrying on specific\nactivities or attaining certain objectives in accordance with special regulations, restrictions or limitations. The\nDistrict\u2019s funds are grouped into three broad fund categories: governmental, proprietary, and fiduciary.\nMajor Governmental Funds Governmental funds are those through which most governmental functions\ntypically are financed. Governmental fund reporting focuses on the sources, uses and balances of current\nfinancial resources.

Available means that the\nresources will be collected within the current fiscal year or are expected to be collected soon enough thereafter,\nto be used to pay liabilities of the current fiscal year. The District considers revenues to be available if they are\ncollected within one year after year-end, except for property taxes, which are considered available if collected\nwithin 60 days. The following revenue sources are considered to be both measurable and available at fiscal year-\nend: State apportionments, interest, certain grants, and other local sources.\nNon-exchange transactions, in which the District receives value without directly giving equal value in return,\ninclude property taxes, certain grants, entitlements, and donations.

Under this statement, a lessee is required to recognize a lease\nliability and an intangible right\u2010to\u2010use lease asset, and a lessor is required to recognize a lease receivable and a\ndeferred inflow of resources, thereby enhancing the relevance and consistency of information about\ngovernments\u2019 leasing activities.\n42",

    "48": "San Francisco Unified School District\nNotes to Financial Statements (Unaudited)\nJune 30, 2022\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates will adversely affect the fair value of an\ninvestment. Generally, the longer the maturity of an investment the greater the sensitivity of its fair value to\nchanges in market interest rates. The District manages its exposure to interest rate risk by investing in the City\nand County of San Francisco Treasury Investment Pool. The sensitivity of the fair values of the District's\ninvestments to market interest rate fluctuation is measured as the weighted average maturity of the investment\nportfolio, which was 569 days on June 30, 2022.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is the risk that an issuer of an investment will not fulfill its obligation to the holder of the investment.\nThis is measured by the assignment of a rating by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. The\nDistrict's investment in the county pool is not rated as of June 30, 2022.\nCustodial Credit Risk - Deposits\nCustodial credit risk for deposits is the risk that, in the event of the failure of a depository financial institution, a\ngovernment will not be able to recover its deposits or will not be able to recover collateral securities that are in\nthe possession of an outside party. The California Government Code and the District\u2019s investment policy do not\ncontain legal or policy requirements that would limit the exposure to custodial credit risk for deposits other than\nthe following provision: the California Government Code requires that a financial institution secure deposits\nmade by state or local governmental units by pledging securities in an undivided collateral pool held by a\ndepository regulated under state law (unless so waived by the governmental unit). The market value of the\npledged securities in the collateral pool must equal at least 110% of the total amount deposited by the public\nagencies. California law also allows financial institutions to secure deposits by pledging first trust deed mortgage\nnotes having a value of 150% of the secured public deposits.\nAs of June 30, 2022, the District\u2019s bank balances were exposed to custodial credit risk because it was uninsured\nand collateralized with securities held by the pledging financial institution\u2019s trust department or agent, but not\nin the name of the District. The District has not calculated the amount subject to this risk.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe District categorizes the fair value measurements of its investments based on the hierarchy established by\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. The fair value hierarchy, which has three levels, is based on the\nvaluation inputs used to measure an asset's fair value. The following provides a summary of the hierarchy used\nto measure fair value:\n\u2022 Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets that the District has the ability to access at the\nmeasurement date.\n\u2022 Level 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets in active\nmarkets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active.\n45",

EC Section 47614(b)(1) states that school districts may charge a charter school a pro-\nrata share of the facilities costs which the school district pays for with unrestricted general fund revenues. The\npro-rata share is based on the ratio of space allocated by the school district to the charter school divided by the\ntotal space of the district.

Best estimates of 20-year geometrically-linked real rates of return and the assumed\nasset allocation for each major asset class, are summarized in the following table:\nLong-Term\nAssumed Asset Expected Real\nAsset Class Allocation Rate of Return\nPublic equity 42% 4.75%\nPrivate equity 13% 6.25%\nReal estate 15% 3.55%\nInflation sensitive 6% 3.25%\nFixed income 12% 1.25%\nRisk mitigating strategies 10% 1.75%\nCash/liquidity 2% -0.35%\n100%\nDiscount Rate\nThe discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 7.10 percent. The projection of cash flows used\nto determine the discount rate assumed the contributions from plan members and employers will be made at\nstatutory contribution rates. Projected inflows from investment earnings were calculated using the long-term\nassumed investment rate of return of 7.10 percent and assume that contributions, benefit payments and\nadministrative expense occurred midyear. Based on these assumptions, the STRP's fiduciary net position was\nprojected to be available to make all projected future benefit payments to current plan members. Therefore, the\nlong-term assumed investment rate of return was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to\ndetermine total pension liability.\nThe following presents the District's proportionate share of the net pension liability calculated using the current\ndiscount rate as well as what the net pension liability would be if it were calculated using a discount rate that is\none percent lower or higher than the current rate:\nNet Pension\nDiscount Rate Liability\n1% decrease (6.10%) $ 738,433,500\nCurrent discount rate (7.10%) 362,752,129\n1% increase (8.10%) 5 0,943,765\n64",

Our report disclaims an opinion on such\nfinancial statements because we were unable to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence, as\ndescribed in the Basis for Disclaimer of Opinion section of that report.\nReport on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nIn planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered the District\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting (internal control) as the basis for designing audit procedures that are\nappropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial statements,\nbut not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the District\u2019s internal control.\nAccordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the District\u2019s internal control.\nA deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow\nmanagement or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or\ndetect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a\ncombination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material\nmisstatement of the entity\u2019s financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a\ntimely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control\nthat is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged\nwith governance.\nOur consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this\nsection and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material\nweaknesses or significant deficiencies and therefore, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may\nexist that were not identified.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of\nassurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in\naccordance with GAAS, Government Auditing Standards, and the Uniform Guidance will always detect\nmaterial noncompliance when it exists. The risk of not detecting material noncompliance resulting from\nfraud is higher than for that resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional\nomissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Noncompliance with the compliance\nrequirements referred to above is considered material, if there is a substantial likelihood that,\nindividually or in the aggregate, it would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user of the\nreport on compliance about the District\u2019s compliance with the requirements of each major federal\nprogram as a whole.\n94",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of\nassurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance\nwith GAAS will always detect material noncompliance when it exists.
