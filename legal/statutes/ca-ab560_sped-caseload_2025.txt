LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST
AB 560, Addis.
                          Special education: resource specialists: special classes.
(1) Existing law requires local educational agencies, as defined, to identify, locate, and assess individuals with exceptional needs and to provide those pupils with a free appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment, with special education and related services as reflected in an individualized education program. Existing law requires each special education local plan area to ensure that a continuum of program options is available to meet the needs of individuals with exceptional needs for special education and related services, as required by federal law. Existing law requires the continuum of program options to include, among other options, a resource specialist program, designated instruction and services, and special classes, as provided.
Existing law requires the resource specialist program to
			 provide, among other things, monitoring of pupil progress on a regular basis, participation in the review and revision of individualized education programs, as appropriate, and referral of pupils who do not demonstrate appropriate progress to the individualized education program team. Existing law requires caseloads for resource specialists to be stated in specified local policies and in accordance with regulations established by the State Board of Education, and prohibits a resource specialist from having a caseload that exceeds 28 pupils.
This bill would require local educational agencies to take all reasonable steps to distribute the workload associated with initial assessments across all resource specialists employed by the local educational agency in an equal manner, unless otherwise collectively bargained. By imposing additional duties on local officials, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(2) Existing law requires special classes that serve pupils with similar and more intensive educational needs to be available, and authorizes special classes to enroll pupils only when the nature or severity of the disability of the individual with exceptional needs is such that education in the regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services, including curriculum modification and behavioral support, cannot be achieved satisfactorily.
This bill would require the Superintendent of Public Instruction, on or before July 1, 2027, to recommend a maximum adult-to-pupil staffing ratio for those special classes, as provided, and to post the
			 recommendation on the department’s internet website. The bill would require the Superintendent to report their recommendations to the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the Legislature and the state board on or before April 1, 2027, as specified.
(3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.
