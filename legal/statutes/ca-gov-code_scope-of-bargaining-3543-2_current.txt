(2) A public school employer shall give reasonable written notice to the exclusive representative of the public school employer’s intent to make any change to matters within the scope of representation of the employees represented by the exclusive
						representative for purposes of providing the exclusive representative a reasonable amount of time to negotiate with the public school employer regarding the proposed changes.
(3) The exclusive representative of certificated personnel has the right to consult on the definition of educational objectives, the determination of the content of courses and curriculum, and the selection of textbooks to the extent those matters are within the discretion of the public school employer under the law.
(4) All matters not specifically enumerated are reserved to the public school employer and may not be a subject of meeting and negotiating, except that this section does not limit the right of the public school employer to consult with any employees or employee organization
						on any matter outside the scope of representation.
(b) Notwithstanding Section 44944 of the Education Code, the public school employer and the exclusive representative shall, upon request of either party, meet and negotiate regarding causes and procedures for disciplinary action, other than dismissal, including a suspension of pay for up to 15 days, affecting certificated employees. If the public school employer and the exclusive representative do not reach mutual agreement, Section 44944 of the Education Code shall apply.
(c) Notwithstanding Section 44955 of the Education Code, the public school employer and the exclusive representative shall, upon request of either party, meet and negotiate regarding procedures and criteria for the layoff of certificated employees for lack of

(d) Notwithstanding Section 45028 of the Education Code, the public school employer and the exclusive representative shall, upon request of either party, meet and negotiate regarding the payment of additional compensation based upon criteria other than years of training and years of experience. If the public school employer and the exclusive representative do not reach mutual agreement, Section 45028 of the Education Code shall apply.
(e) Pursuant to Section 45028 of the Education Code, the public school employer and the exclusive representative shall, upon the request of either party, meet and negotiate a salary schedule based on
						criteria other than a uniform allowance for years of training and years of experience. If the public school employer and the exclusive representative do not reach mutual agreement, the provisions of Section 45028 of the Education Code requiring a salary schedule based upon a uniform allowance for years of training and years of experience shall apply. A salary schedule established pursuant to this subdivision shall not result in the reduction of the salary of a teacher.
