41376.
(a) The Superintendent, in computing apportionments and allowances from the State School Fund for the second principal apportionment, shall determine the following for the regular day classes of the elementary schools maintained by each school district:
(1) (A) For grades 1 to 3, inclusive, the Superintendent shall determine the number of classes, the number of pupils enrolled in each class, the total enrollment in all such classes, the average number of pupils enrolled per class, and the total of the numbers of pupils which are in excess of thirty (30) in each class.
(B) For those school districts
				  that do not have any classes with an enrollment in excess of 32 and whose average size for all the classes is 30.0 or less, there shall be no excess declared. For those school districts that have one or more classes in excess of an enrollment of 32 or whose average size for all the classes is more than 30, the excess shall be the total of the number of pupils which are in excess of 30 in each class having an enrollment of more than 30.
(2) For grades 4 to 8, inclusive, the Superintendent shall determine the total number of pupils enrolled, the number of full-time equivalent classroom teachers, and the average number of pupils per each full-time equivalent classroom teacher. The Superintendent shall also determine the excess if any, of pupils enrolled in such grades in the following manner:
(A) Determine the number of pupils by which the average number of pupils per each full-time
				  equivalent classroom teacher for the current fiscal year exceeds the greater of the average number of pupils per each full-time equivalent classroom teacher in all the appropriate districts of the state, as determined by the Superintendent for October 30, 1964, or the average number of pupils per each full-time equivalent classroom teacher which existed in the school district on either October 30, 1964, or March 30, 1964, as selected by the governing board of the school district.
(B) Multiply the number determined in subparagraph (A) by the number of full-time equivalent classroom teachers of the current fiscal year.
(C) Reduce the number determined in subparagraph (B) by the remainder that results from dividing such number by the average number of pupils per each full-time equivalent teacher for October 30, 1964, as determined by the Superintendent in subparagraph (A).
(3) The Superintendent shall compute the product obtained by multiplying the excess number of pupils, if any, in paragraph (1) by ninety-seven hundredths.
(4) If the school district reports that it has maintained, during the current fiscal year, any classes in which there were enrolled pupils in excess of 30 per class pursuant to paragraph (1), and there is no excess number of pupils computed pursuant to paragraph (2), the Superintendent shall decrease the average daily attendance reported under the provisions of Section 41601 by the product determined pursuant to paragraph (3).
(5) If the school district reports that it has maintained, during the current fiscal year, no classes in which there were enrolled pupils in excess of 30 per class determined pursuant to paragraph (1), and there is an excess number of pupils
				  computed pursuant to paragraph (2), the Superintendent shall compute the product obtained by multiplying the excess number of pupils computed pursuant to paragraph (2) by ninety-seven hundredths. The Superintendent shall decrease the average daily attendance reported under the provisions of Section 41601 by the resulting product.
(6) If the school district reports that it has maintained, during the current fiscal year, any classes in which there were enrolled pupils in excess of 30 per class determined pursuant to paragraph (1), and there is an excess number of pupils computed pursuant to paragraph (2), the Superintendent shall add to the product determined pursuant to paragraph (3), the product determined pursuant to paragraph (5), and shall decrease the average daily attendance reported under the provisions of Section 41601 by this total amount.
(b) The governing board of each
				  school district maintaining elementary schools shall report for the fiscal year 1964–65 and each year thereafter the information required for the determination to be made by the Superintendent pursuant to this section in accordance with instructions provided on forms furnished and prescribed by the Superintendent. Such information shall be reported by the school district together with, and at the same time as, the reports required to be filed for the second principal apportionment of the State School Fund. The forms on which the data and information is reported shall include a certification by the superintendent of each school district or its chief administrative officer that the data is correct and accurate for the period covered, according to his or her best information and belief.
(c) For purposes of this section, a “full-time equivalent classroom teacher” means an employee of an elementary, high school, or unified school district, employed
				  in a position requiring certification qualifications and whose duties require him to teach pupils in the elementary schools of that district in regular day classes for the full time for which he is employed during the regular schoolday. In reporting the total number of full-time equivalent classroom teachers, there shall be included, in addition to those employees defined above, the full-time equivalent of all fractional time for which employees in positions requiring certification qualifications are required to devote to teaching pupils in the elementary schools of the district in regular day classes during the regular schoolday.
(d) For purposes of this section, the number of pupils enrolled in each class means the average of the active enrollment in that class on the last teaching day of each school month that ends before April 15 of each school year.
(e) This section shall not
				  be applicable to school districts with less than 101 units of average daily attendance for the current fiscal year.
(f) The Superintendent shall adopt rules and regulations that he or she may deem necessary for the effective administration of this section. Those rules and regulations may specify that no decrease in average daily attendance reported under the provisions of Section 41601 shall be made for a school district on account of large classes due to instructional television or team teaching, which may necessarily involve class sizes at periods during the day larger than the standard set forth in this section.
(Amended by Stats. 2015, Ch. 19, Sec. 40.   (SB 78)   Effective June 24, 2015.)
