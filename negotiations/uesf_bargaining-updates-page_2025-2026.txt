2.7 Bargaining Update
https://uesf.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/514CCB92-72AD-4A56-A44F-7B1B5635CAED-Captioned-by-Zubtitle.mp4
We are thrilled to announce that we reached an agreement to protect Sanctuary Schools in our contract! This movement from the district is a direct result of the organizing and pressure our communities have placed on SFUSD. Thank you for all of your support.
UESF educators worked for nearly 12 hours today to reach an agreement.  But were disappointed that there’s still little movement on wages, and there’s still no fully paid family healthcare. Despite Dr. Su  joining us at the bargaining table, the district is clearly not taking our demands seriously. They are still telling us that any salary increases will come at the cost of previous contract wins. They are still not addressing the widespread crisis in our special education classrooms. And they are still not offering us a contract with fully funded family healthcare.

Also, see the comparison chart we made at the bottom of this email.
There is nearly 1 day left until we go on strike for the schools we know our students deserve. Time is running out. The district needs to step up.
San Francisco! We need you in this fight!

2.5 Bargaining Update
https://uesf.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/BUpdate-Captioned-by-Zubtitle.mp4
Tonight –
after announcing our historic strike this morning
, our big bargaining team met with SFUSD representatives. After multiple public messages, statements, and media announcements from the district that they were prepared to formally offer educators fully funded family healthcare, the proposal passed tonight did not include any such language, nor did it advance movement in other crucial areas, like special education.
We are disappointed to come to yet another bargaining session with little meaningful movement by the district, especially after a fact-finding report made recommendations affirming the district’s ability to do so. Tonight, every proposal they gave us was completely contingent on increasing our class sizes and cutting existing benefits, site funding, pay, and staff.
You can view the SFUSD proposal package here.
Also, see below the comparison chart we made at the bottom of this email for a full breakdown.
They are clearly not serious about stabilizing our schools. But we are.
UESF educators are STILL waiting for SFUSD to bring a serious proposal to the table. Until then, we remain ready to strike for the schools our students deserve should the district force us to on Monday, Feb 9.
There is still time for the district to figure it out and avoid this crisis of their own making. We invited them back to the table on Saturday to give them more time to address the urgent crises in our schools.  We hope they use this time to create a serious, stabilizing offer.
To our entire school community, we invite you to join us!

– you can donate to our solidarity fund and make your voice heard by sending a letter to the Board of Education demanding that they join us in prioritizing our students.
2.5 UESF Strike Announcement
Dear Educators, Families, and San Francisco Community,
The growing vacancy and turnover crisis in SFUSD harms students every single day. For almost a year, educators have proposed real solutions for stability — including fully funded family healthcare, a Special Education workload model to improve working and learning conditions, and competitive wages that keep high-quality educators here. District management has not acted with the urgency our students deserve.
Over 5,200 educators overwhelmingly voted yes last week to strike because there had been no urgency to meet our demands and proposals that prioritize stability for our students. Since the strike vote, SFUSD management has begun exploring creative solutions, but so far, no proposals have been made. The 100+ person UESF negotiations team is scheduled to meet on Thursday and is ready to hear from district management. We hope they now feel it is necessary to come to the table with an offer that provides real solutions to stabilize our schools.
While we appreciate the late stage urgency, we are left with no other option but to announce that, without an agreement that meets the needs of our students and educators,
United Educators of San Francisco intends to strike on Monday, Feb 9th.
You can see the live stream of our press conference from this morning on
Instagram
and
Facebook
.
We didn’t come to this decision easily, and we do not take the next steps lightly. We want to be in our classrooms with our students where we belong every single day.
And we know this truth: The status quo is failing our students. If we have to strike, we will strike for the students currently without a permanent educator. If district management chooses not to take responsibility, we will strike so educators can afford to insure their families and housing in our communities. If the Board of Education does not take responsibility, we will strike to stop the exodus of highly qualified educators.
We can’t wait. Because every child deserves safe, stable classrooms and schools.

San Francisco Educators on Brink of Potential Strike as Impasse Process Ends
United Educators of San Francisco have approved a strike if the district does not resolve high turnover, vacancy crisis destabilizing schools
SAN FRANCISCO
— San Francisco Educators remain committed to continuing their fight for improved working and learning conditions as the impasse process has ended today with no agreement that would bring stability to classrooms and schools. The release of a
report
from a state-appointed neutral states that the district can and should offer educators fully funded family healthcare and raises, affirms the threats to our immigrant and housing insecure communities are real, and acknowledges improvements in special education must be made to bring stability to the district. Over 5,200 educators overwhelmingly voted yes last week to a potential strike if SFUSD leadership cannot come to an agreement that prioritizes stability for their students. UESF will hold a press conference Thursday morning to discuss their next steps. The 100 person+ UESF negotiations team is prepared to negotiate Thursday and Friday evenings.
“The report does not go far enough–and the recommendations here alone will not solve the stability crisis in our district. But, we are happy to see validation of what we already know–that SFUSD can and must stabilize staffing and special education programs for our students,” President Cassondra Curiel said. “Now is the time for the district to come to the table with real solutions and show the community that they are fully committed to funding the classrooms and schools our students and communities deserve.”
The United Educators of San Francisco have been negotiating a contract for almost a year, with the goal of stabilizing classrooms and school sites. Parents and educators point to a crisis of vacancies and years of high turnover destabilizing the district. Educators are demanding fully funded family healthcare, raises and improvements to working and learning conditions that would keep educators in San Francisco. As attacks escalate on immigrants and the cost of living increases, educators are also advocating for the district to commit to important protections for both housing insecure and immigrant students and families.
Teachers are especially focused on improving the learning conditions of their special education students. The most vulnerable students in the district have been subjected to the least stable learning environments as unsustainable working conditions cause educators to leave the district each year. High needs special education classrooms have gone without a permanent teacher for years.  The district also has hundreds of  vacant paraeducator positions that are crucial to providing legally mandated access to learning for students receiving special education services.
San Francisco educators receive some of the lowest contributions to their healthcare costs among neighboring districts, which leads many of them to seek work elsewhere. Other nearby districts offer fully covered health care. Current educator healthcare contributions have risen to up to $1,500 a month, and up to 40% of the paychecks of some of the lowest earning crucial classroom support staff. This too is a major factor in the vacancy crisis facing the district with hundreds of positions unfilled still this year.
District officials recently allocated $111 million dollars to a rainy day fund, money UESF members say needs to be directed back to classrooms and school sites. The district’s last formal proposal was for a 2% wage increase that included major concessions for educators.

2.3 Bargaining Update
Watch Video
We have received so many messages about an offer that Superintendent Maria Su made to UESF. Unfortunately, at this point, UESF’S bargaining team has no proposal reflecting the offer detailed in her messages. Now is the time for Superintendent Su to act. Our community is standing with us in our fight for fully funded family benefits, improved Special Education working and learning conditions, a raise so we can attract and retain educators, and sanctuary schools and housing protections for our families. We remain prepared to hear any real solutions the district may formally bring to the table that will stabilize our district for our students, educators, and families.
Strike Authorization Vote
Over 5,200 UESF members voted 97.6% YES to authorize UESF leadership to call for a strike if District Management makes it necessary. Now is the time for the district to act. We remain prepared to hear any real solutions the district may formally bring to the table that will stabilize our district for our students, educators, and families as we await the Feb 4 fact finding report to be released. Below is the press release we sent out over the weekend. Be sure to check out this
San Francisco Chronicle article
! We will share updates as they become available.
97.6% of Educators in San Francisco Vote Yes to Potential Strike for their Students
United Educators of San Francisco affirm they will do whatever it takes to win stability for students and improvements to special education services
SAN FRANCISCO—
Over 5,200 educators in San Francisco have overwhelmingly voted yes to a potential strike if SFUSD leadership cannot come to an agreement that prioritizes stability for their students. The announcement comes in the midst of nearly 300 educators coming together to prepare for the potential strike at today’s Strike School. The United Educators of San Francisco have been negotiating a contract for almost a year, with the goal of stabilizing classrooms and school sites. Parents and educators point to a crisis of vacancies and years of high turnover destabilizing the district. Educators are demanding fully funded family healthcare and improvements to working and learning conditions that would keep educators in San Francisco. As attacks escalate on immigrants and the cost of living increases, educators are also advocating for the district to commit to important protections for both housing insecure and immigrant students and families.

“The time is now for the district to act,” President Cassondra Curiel said. “Our community is standing with us in our fight for the consistent classroom teachers, special education supports, and stable programs our students and families need and deserve. Instead of siphoning money out of our schools and into savings accounts, or contracting out to traveling psychologists or non-district special education support staff, SFUSD should be prioritizing stability for our students. What comes next is ultimately up to the district and their actions, but San Francisco educators are making it clear that we are more than willing to do everything we can for our community.”
United Educators of San Francisco will now await the non-binding fact-finding recommendations to be issued this week in the final step before any potential strike. Educators remain committed to reaching a fair settlement that provides:
Fully funded family healthcare and competitive wages for all educators
Safe and supportive working and learning conditions in special education
Sanctuary and Housing protections for students and families
1.30 Bargaining Update
https://uesf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026.01.30community-support-Captioned-by-Zubtitle-1.mp4
We have had another historic week in our organization. Yesterday, we finished picking up over 5,000 ballots that y’all cast at your school and work sites! We’ve been hard at work counting the votes at UESF HQ, and we plan to share the results at our strike captain training this weekend. Once our site leaders receive the vote count update, we will share it publicly on social media and with the press.
In the meantime, you should be proud of the incredible work you and your coworkers continue to do to strengthen your school communities. The critical work needed to win the schools our students deserve if District Management forces us to go out on strike. We continue to await formal written proposals from District Management that aren’t relying on take backs from our students and educators. The last time educators in San Francisco went on strike was in 1979. We clearly don’t take this step lightly, but we will stand up for the schools our students and educators deserve.
More than 500 families and community supporters show up to our town hall to hear what it would mean for us to potentially go on strike. Over 900 community members have
already signed up to support a picket as of this afternoon
! It’s families, educators, and students together who win, so be sure to stay connected. You can share the brand new
community landing page
we launched this week on the CTA website. Parents and community allies can learn more about the fight for safe, stable schools. Sign up to stay connected and
take action today by sending a letter directly to District Management.
Together with our families and community, we are letting the district know that enough is enough. The time is NOW for the district to do what’s right and invest in the schools our students deserve.
1.23 Bargaining Update
On Friday, Jan.23, UESF and SFUSD participated in a hearing that ended without enough progress to reach an agreement. We entered formal impasse proceedings after 10 months of bargaining. UESF passed 24 proposals with the expressed interest of ensuring stability for our students, fully staffed schools, and wages and benefits that retain and attract educators. We have been clear about our highest priorities for students and educators: fully covered family healthcare, improved working and learning conditions for Special Education, a wage increase, sanctuary protections for immigrant families, and housing protections for unhoused families. SFUSD rejected all of these proposals month after month. Impasse was declared. As part of the impasse process, UESF and SFUSD participated in mediation and then in fact-finding. The fact-finding report will be issued on Feb.4.
After the hearing during panel deliberations, we were encouraged to see the district bring forward concepts to the panel that showed movement towards our core demands. Unfortunately, these ideas did not go nearly far enough, and—just like their only formal proposal on compensation during negotiations—came with huge concessions our team knew our members would never stand for. The district’s movement, even toward solutions that don’t meet students and educators needs, shows our collective power is real. We remain prepared to hear any real solutions the district may formally bring to the table that will stabilize our district for our students, educators, and families.
Our second strike vote is officially underway, and over 4,250 members have voted (both regular and provisional ballots) in just the first 3 days! This is an incredible show of strength and unity. The vote will run through January 28, and we expect to continue to see a strong showing of members voting to  authorize the union leadership to call for a strike if the District makes it necessary. The last time educators in San Francisco went on strike was in 1979. We clearly don’t take this step lightly, but we will stand up for the schools our students and educators deserve.
The urgency of our demands has never been clearer: Special education students continue to lack the support they need, dependent healthcare costs have become unaffordable, educators need livable wages, and immigrant and unhoused communities are under attack. We demand that SFUSD prioritizes the stability of our schools. Over the next few days and weeks, stay connected to your site structures, each other, and your students and families. Together we will win.
Second Strike Vote
Second Strike Vote: Time’s Up, SFUSD! It’s time to take our final strike vote, held at every site from January 21 to January 28. We’re at the last step of the mediation process, and we know that our students can’t wait for safe, stable schools. We’re voting yes. Together, we will win the schools our students deserve.
Our demands are more important than ever: Our SPED students are underserved, dependent healthcare costs are through the roof, educators need livable wages, and our immigrant and unhoused communities are under constant threat. Over the past 10 months, we’ve been met with nothing but rejection and an insulting offer of 2%, along with major concessions. We know the money is there. We demand that SFUSD prioritizes the stability of students and communities.
January 21 Membership Meeting
We will conduct a
membership meeting at 6pm on Wednesday January 21st
over Zoom to discuss strike issues for any member who has yet to engage at their worksites. Please note that the information presented at this meeting is the same as the information all site leaders/UBCs have been sharing, and is also accessible in
Bargaining Team reports

November 14 Bargaining Update
–
As we approach parent conference week, you once again prove that you are deeply committed to our students and families, and that is why you fight for the schools they deserve. This past week, thousands of you picketed to show your support for your big bargaining team and the demands that will continue to stabilize your schools. Everything we have done till now has been to prepare us for the time we are approaching. For the past eight months, we have worked hard to come to a negotiated settlement with the district. Despite our intentions, the district and the union remain far apart.
Monday’s mediation session
did not result in any agreements, and as a result, we will likely proceed to fact finding next.
Your picket power this week
is important because it shows that you are serious and prepared across the entire district to win a fair contract. Pickets are an important practice in collective power, where you and your colleagues practice leading chants, taking attendance, and disseminating information from the bargaining team. These practices, paired with our communication structures, such as this video message in our Friday newsletter, are the foundation that will guide us through the coming period, during which we should expect misinformation about our bargaining demands. You must lean on these structures to maintain unity and to sustain the fight for the schools our students deserve.
In the headlines, some media outlets simply parrot the superintendent’s perspective that there is no money and that more cuts will stabilize the school district budget. The current superintendent, who is not an educator, is not the first superintendent to make this statement. Every year we have been in negotiations with the district, they have claimed the same thing. This is despite the facts you’ve seen with your own eyes:  year after year, SFUSD closes its books with millions in surplus cash, year after year, they send out pink slips but start the next year with empty classrooms,  year after year, they put families on a long waitlist to enroll their students in SFUSD while forcing under enrollment at schools.
With this most recent unaudited actuals, UESF observed that the District continues to mismanage its budget and does a very poor job of aligning costs with the needs of our schools. In the October budget presentation to the Board of Education, the District showed that the variance between its projected ending fund balance and its final fund balance was almost 70%. Normally, a best practice variance would range from 3-5%. It means that the District projected to have only $130 million in reserves in its unrestricted general fund and ended up with $220 million.  This same behavior is repeated throughout the budget and has been the norm for the past several years. Your union is keenly aware of how poorly the District’s budget has been managed. Your union has pointed out year after year through our own analysis and reports that the District does not have position control and still struggles to know where people’s placements are, we know that they are over contracting special education services instead of prioritizing the hiring of our members and that they cannot offer quality control for the growing list of contracts offered to outside companies. Your union knows the budget better than they do, which is why we’re willing to negotiate when we get presented with actual figures.
Another talking point from the District is that they will have to close schools and make tough site budget decisions to balance their budget. You, your colleagues, and your union deeply understand the needs and opportunities at schools throughout this entire district. Your union has 120 UBCs, 100% coverage by union leaders at schools, and stays in regular contact. Management’s current approach is simply to react and then make excuses for their mismanagement, all while expecting you to remain silent and suffer the consequences.
The lack of seriousness with which the School Board and management approached the planned changes to the overly confusing and universally despised enrollment process, and their inability to plan out 2 to 3 years for programs that would welcome our San Francisco families, shows that all levels of the District leadership offer no actual vision for our public schools. Time and again, San Franciscans overwhelmingly supported public schools by passing propositions to invest more money, so our city deserves something better than simply making excuses for not paying folx, hiring adequate staffing, and making attractive programming for families.
In the coming months, you and your colleagues will organize the strongest actions UESF has taken in a generation. The power of thousands of UESF members – the educators, paraeducators, nurses, counselors, social workers, family liaisons, and more is needed to force this district to do its job. You and your coworkers have the power to educate and welcome families and fight for our students. As we approach the first strike vote on December 3 at Balboa High School, it is your power and that strike vote that will show the district we mean business. Good luck with your parent conferences because they always show overwhelmingly. They support their educators, and we will need them as we build up our actions.

On Monday, November 10, we sat in mediation from 9:30 to 3 p.m. We hope to make a deal for dependent healthcare, stability in special education, equitable wages, and protections for students and school communities. Unfortunately, we are not any closer to an agreement for the schools our students, communities, and educators deserve. It’s crucial that all UESF educators show up to your site’s November 12 picket. We know that the only time the district management works is when they see us move collectively, reach out to UBC for your site’s time, and we will see you on the line this Wednesday.
_______________________________________________________________________
November 12 Practice Pickets
After 8 months of bargaining, dozens of proposal exchanges, and an expired contract, District Management has left us no choice but to get strike ready. On Tuesday, October 14 you delivered over 4,000 strike ready signatures to the Board of Education. Our unity could be seen in the streets at 555 Franklin as our picket stretched around the entire block! District Management and the Board of Education must take seriously our clear commitment to strike for the schools our students deserve if the district makes it necessary.
Our next step is to hold practice pickets at every SFUSD school and worksite on Wednesday, November 12!
We will picket for fully funded dependent health benefits, SpEd workload model, housing for our families, raises, and sanctuary schools!
We worked with a local artist to create these posters that you can hang up outside your classroom doors and work spaces. Officers and UESF Staff will be dropping the posters off to your UBC reps and we can’t wait to see them in our schools across the city!

.
We ended the night by declaring an impasse. After 8 months of meetings, dozens of proposal exchanges, and an expired contract, the district is still unwilling to agree to our demands:
Our SPED programs across the district should be set up to support our students and staff – We need a workload model now!
All educators, both certified and classified, are due an increase in pay.
The cost of healthcare should be covered for all dependents.
Our schools are sanctuary schools, and our contract should reflect that.
Our district should utilize its resources to ensure that our most vulnerable students have access to shelter.
Despite over 75% of UESF members proclaiming our readiness to strike, the District refuses to act with the urgency demanded in this moment. The district management’s refusal to move anywhere on our high priority demands, like benefits and workload, and low or no cost demands like protecting us from losing work to AI and contractors, has left us no choice but to move to impasse.
Last week, we announced that a supermajority of our members, over 4,000 of you, have signed the strike ready petition to say they are willing to strike if necessary! Join us on Tuesday, October 14, at 5 pm in front of 555 Franklin St. for a rally to support those signatures and deliver them directly to the Board of Education Meeting.

The District presented a package proposal that would repurpose a 2% raise if we agreed to the elimination of AP preps, Paid Sabbatical Leaves, Department Head Preps and Stipends, and Class size limits.
As a bargaining team, we unanimously rejected their package.
This is effectively a zero percent raise. The District wants to pay for the 2% by increasing workloads and taking away benefits already in our contract.
We just launched our strike readiness petition, and already over 20 sites have met or exceeded their signature goal! There are 2 weeks left to connect with your UBC and get ready to take action. If the District makes it necessary, we will prepare to strike for the schools our students and educators deserve.
Mark your calendars for October 14,
when UESF members will show our power by delivering our thousands of strike ready petition signatures at the Board of Education meeting.

We hit the ground running this week, bargaining again for the first time since June. After they canceled our summer bargaining session, the District continues to offer a 0% raise for classified and certificated employees, and our only TA so far is around creating a new committee. We are now working with an expired contract, and it is all hands on deck!
Stay in touch with your UBC. On Saturday, August 23, leaders from all the Bay Area Educator Unions are coming together for the very first regional Strike Readiness Academy!  At the Academy, we will meet to lay out our plans to win the schools our students deserve and launch a petition. Check in with your site leader to sign on to the Strike Ready Petition next week.

.
District Management continues to reject most of our proposals, claiming they want to “work with us” but offering zero language to do so. They continue to state they don’t believe certain things should be in the contract. They also introduced a
brand new proposal
, more than three months into bargaining, knowing that our current contract ends at the end of this month. We are nowhere close to agreeing on most proposals, let alone a new contract that would improve and stabilize our schools.
Over the Summer, we will continue to prepare to hit the ground running in August. There is no question that our organizing in the spring had an impact on avoiding so many layoffs, and we’ll need to bring that same energy into the fall to fight for the contract our students deserve!
_______________________________________________________________________
May 20 Bargaining Update
Our bargaining team met with District Management for our last in-person school year session on May 20! Below is a summary of our session and next steps. You can also

.
Unfortunately, the District did not come to the table ready to negotiate a deal to stabilize our schools in the Fall. They want to freeze all pay at current levels for 2 years, and did not come prepared with a response to all of our proposals.
We know that our power lies in the organizing that we’ve been doing with each other, our students, and our families all year at our school sites. Expanding that support is exactly what we need to come back in the Fall and win the schools our students deserve.
As we head into the summer, we will continue to meet with the District to negotiate small things, but we will not negotiate anything significant like our economic proposals or reach a tentative agreement when our membership is on break.
We will resume normal negotiations when we return to our school sites in the Fall. And can organize together to win a contract that we all deserve. We have proven that we are stronger at the negotiation table with our big bargaining team and at our school sites, where we have all spent the last few months organizing and picketing.
It might be a few weeks before we have another video update for you, but we’ll update you all when we have anything to report. We hope you have a wonderful summer, and we look forward to continuing to organize with you all for the schools our students deserve in the Fall.

The District finally responded to our 20 proposals and made it clear they’re okay with the status quo. There’s no need to enshrine housing for homeless students, monitor overheated classrooms, consistently document violent incidents, or protect teachers who
are injured
on the job. They feel no urgency to ensure that destabilizing layoffs don’t happen when vacancies are in the hundreds. There is no need to address the crisis of special educator burnout or acknowledge the many needs of our students receiving special education services
rather
than use the outdated caseload model. They’d rather wait for the crisis to arrive than try to prepare ahead of time– a classic reactive rather than proactive stance.

very
little time to reach an agreement before our contract ends this summer!
They offered cost estimates for our proposals, which matched our own– shout out to our research team for spot-on calculations.

Our bargaining
team met with the
District
on April 14 for our third bargaining session! Below is a summary of our session and PDFs of all six proposals.
You can also
download our report out slide deck
and
view our bargaining update video on Instagram
and
youtube
.
SFUSD’s representatives did not offer any proposals of their own, nor did they offer any additional response on the 20 proposals that seek to stabilize our schools, improve educator pay, fully staff schools, and address dignified learning and working conditions.
Our five proposals focused and services for our students, paraeducator and T10 workdays; demanding an end to unsupported advisories and combination classes; clarification of classifications for Head counselors, Deans, and School Counselors; And a solution for the unmanageable caseloads and class sizes that are driving people from our district.
Respect Paraeducators: 35 (or 40) hr work week & Planning Time
Aligns paraeducator workday with Certificated workday.
Provides planning time for classroom paraeducators.
Offers T10 Security Aids the ability to work
8 hour
days (including breaks).
Counselor Workload
Ensures there is at least
1
head counselor,
1
dean, and
1
school counselor at each secondary site (including K-8)
Clarifies the roles of head counselor vs dean
Provides extra counselors, beyond proposed caseloads, for schools with high focal populations (
i.e.
newcomer students, foster youth,
etc
)
Class Sizes & Caseload Limits
Strengthens contract language from class size goals to class size limits.
Reduces
case load
numbers for most service providers, including counselors reducing their caseload to 1:200
Provides compensation of $1,000 per
student,
per semester for unit members if class sizes or caseloads go over the limits (up to two students over)
Fully Staffing School – Equitable Staffing Model
Creates an equitable school staffing model that ensures:
1
full time
social worker at all schools
.5 or
full time
nurse at all elementary schools
1
full time
nurse at all secondary schools
2 centrally funded positions for student & family services
funding allocations for schools with high focal student populations
a report for the Union every January around their plan to meet this staffing model
Honoring Student Time
Ensures that the number of students with IEPs in a co-taught class shall not exceed 50%, with the goal being 33%
Limits grades 4/5 combo classes size to 28 students
Eliminates combo classes in grades K-3
States that advisory cannot require teacher prep and
is not considered
additional
class
In our last negotiations session 3 weeks ago, UESF passed our highest priorities: a workload model, fully paid health benefits for those with dependents, and a raise for all educators. District management was unable to respond despite having three work weeks between sessions. This was an insult to the time and effort of our bargaining team as well as the families and students we serve. We are living through instability caused by decades of mismanagement.
Key Dates:
April 21-25: 83 city-wide info pickets
April 28: Next bargaining session

March 24 Bargaining Update
Our
125 member
team met with the
District
on March 24 for our second bargaining session! Below is a summary of our session and PDFs of all six proposals.
You can also
download our report out slide
deck
and
view our bargaining update video on Instagram
.
During our session, we passed
6
proposals to the district, including our highest priorities:
improved educator pay,
employer funded
healthcare for members and dependants, and a SPED workload model.
In addition to these economic
proposals
we also presented proposals on San
Francisco
sanctuary city status, protections from artificial intelligence
and
standardized hours for paraeducators.
The district rejected our proposals for shelter and housing for our students and families and almost entirely threw out our request for
protections
against privatization.
March 24 UESF Proposal PDFs
1. Employer-Funded Health Benefits
Provides all members with dependents with fully paid coverage on Kaiser health plan
Ensures any member who elects a non-Kaiser plan will only contribute the
difference
between the Kaiser plan and their choice (for both themselves and dependents)
2. Improve Educator Pay
Increase
classified
pay by 14% over 2 years,
7% year 1 and 7% year 2
Increases floating holidays from 6 to 10
Increases pay differential for bilingual classified staff and for some SpEd paras
Adds a Career Increment C & clarifies 3 years at each increment
Increase
certificated
pay by 9% over 2 years
4.5% year 1 and 4.5% year 2
Add an additional schedule for BA +75
3. Workload Model
Transforms how we measure the appropriate amount of work for many service providers (note: SLPs already have a workload model in place)
Shifts from caseload model to workload model
It creates a points system that takes into account SAI minutes, initials/triennials, ERMHS,
Behavior Intervention Plans, Intensive Individual Services, and case management
Caseload limits will be based on the amount of work required not just the number of students
In practice, this will lower caseloads for educators with particularly time-intensive students and increase the likelihood that they can actually provide services adequately
4. Standardized Work Hours for Paraeducators
Establishes FTE status for paraeducators
Ensures paraeducators qualify for stipends, benefits, and other contractual provisions tied to FTE status
5. Sanctuary Schools, Sanctuary Employer
Requires adherence by District
to Sanctuary City policies and mandates the availabilitiy of training on said policies for all unit members
Requires the District to maintain an emergency management website with info on ICE activity
Provides protections, legal support, and release days for unit members dealing with immigration and/or work authorization issues
6. Protections from Effects of AI
Ensures the district will not replace UESF members or our work with AI
Ensures there is oversight, warning, training for unit members, and analysis of any AI systems that are put into place
Prevents from the district using AI to monitor, evaluate, or collect data on the bargaining unit member.
We have three big dates coming up so be sure to mark your calendars!

March 10 Bargaining Update
Our big bargaining team has grown and we are 125 members strong from 80 different schools and worksites! During our session on March 10, we passed nine UESF proposals across the table. As this was our first meeting, we introduced a lot of proposals so that we could get as much done as soon and as smoothly as possible.
We have created many ways to keep members informed after each bargaining session! Below is a summary of our first session and PDFs of all nine proposals. You can also
download our report out slide deck
and
view our bargaining update video on Instagram.
March 10 UESF Proposal PDFs
1. Paraeducator Pension and Retirement
Creates a research committee to analyze potential pension/retirement plans for classified staff
2. EED/Part-Time School Age Teachers: PD Days and Break Pay
Provides parity for part-time school age teachers with their full-time counterparts in terms of benefits, PD days, and paid time off
3. Impacts of Financial Instability
Requires District to complete a community impact report before layoffs
Requires District to refrain from layoffs when vacancies exist
Establishes rules
to deal with
educator assignment and reassignment in the case of school closures/mergers.
4. Shelter and Housing for Students and Families
Formalizes and expands the Stay Over Program (started at BVHM) to provide emergency housing and support SFUSD families with access to critical services
Note: this is
what’s
called
a
“
Common good proposal
”
— something we choose to bargain for the good of our students, families, educators, and school communities
.
5. Safety: Intervention Tracking System
Proposes a uniform incident report system
implemented District-wide to track interventions and supports
Said system provides all unit members access to pertinent information such as BIPs, safety plans, and past referrals.
Formalizes the right of educators to remove themselves from the school environment following an attack, assault, or injury.
6. Priority School Assignment
Allows UESF
members’
children to receive priority school
assignment
at
member’s
work
site
.
Guarantees approval of all inter-district transfer applications for
members’
children
7. Protections from Privatization/Contracting Out
Introduces guardrails and restrictions to the District contracting out positions that could be filled by unit members
Requires
that
contractors are used only in emergencies and
are
held
to the
same
duties as unit members.
Ensures all unit member positions
are publicly posted
to allow for hiring to occur before contracting out
8. Teacher Librarian Working Conditions
Protects transition time, adequate break time, and max of 6 classes/day
Formalizes a process for reassignment with more protections for teacher librarians to reduce random reassignments
9. Facilities
Proposes minimum standards for facilities, including an acceptable temperature range of 65 – 75 F.
Requires
District
to provide schools with tools to monitor air quality, temperature, mold, etc.
Requires age-appropriate facilities for TK / pre-K spaces.
Everything
that
was
presented
at our first bargaining session is either
low cost
or
no cost
.
While these proposals
won’t
fix decades of fiscal mismanagement, these nine proposals could go a long way toward stabilizing schools for staff, students, communities, and
admistration
. We have developed over 20 proposals we will pass in the coming weeks that all seek to improve working and learning conditions as we fight for stable and fully staffed schools.
After each
session
we will share
out
links to the
pdfs
to
each proposal.
As members who engage with San
Francisco’s
students daily, we know
what’s
needed to rebuild our schools after decades of divestment. We understand that the educators on the ground are often the only stabilizing force in a district in disarray.
It’s
challenging to do our jobs with the specter of closing schools and layoffs hanging over our heads!  Our students, their families, and our staff deserve stable and well-staffed environments
in which
to learn and teach.
Our next bargaining session
is set
for March 24.
Be sure to
wear your union shirt to school that day to show your support for the bargaining team! After each bargaining session, you can expect a video update and slide deck to
be shared
, including links to all the proposals passed and the next steps. Your UBCs and work sites are more organized than ever, so check in with your site leaders for updates. Additionally, stay informed by following the UESF social media accounts on
