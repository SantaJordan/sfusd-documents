Announcement Message
Dear SFUSD Community:
This morning, SFUSD received notice from United Educators of San Francisco (UESF) about their intent to strike on Monday, Feb. 9. We value our educators, and I do not want a strike. I share the concern and uncertainty this creates for families. I am committed to working around the clock to reach an agreement while also preparing for possible disruptions to the school day.
Schools are open today.
My priority is to avoid a strike and reach an agreement with our labor partners. We are meeting at 5:00 pm today which will allow us to present our proposal that meets many of our educators’ requests, including to fully fund family healthcare and provide wages we can afford. I believe we can have a meaningful and productive negotiation session with UESF, and we will be sharing additional information throughout the day.
Families, please
update your student’s emergency contact information in ParentVUE
to receive the latest information resources as soon as they become available.
